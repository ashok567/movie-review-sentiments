review,prediction
"There is no way that I could describe my emotions for this movie. I'm totally speechless. I haven't laughed (even cried) this much in Marvel movie or even in any movie. I'm fully on my emotion, there are so many tears of joy and loss. Amazing story, the acting is outstanding, epic action, great CGI, the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie, amazing performance. I love it more than 3000.

Happiness, sadness, pure joy, excitement... I'm gonna miss this moment in my whole life because let's face it- it's been awhile movies can bring such a big enthusiasm like this.

It is such an experience you'll gonna remember it forever. People are clapping, laughing, crying, full of a state emotion. It's 3 hours long but it went by like a finger snapping by Thanos, and now I'm thinking I'm actually in Quantum Realm because it felt like 5 seconds. Even though you know where the story is gonna bring you because it's still a 'superhero movie' but it left me speechless. It's not just a superhero movie, it's more than that.

**SPOILER ALERT**

Even some characters that you didn't like before, you will love them in this movie. Like Captain Marvel. I didn't like her before in her own movie but in Endgame they showed how powerful, how strong and how capable she really is. And now I kinda love her! But Marvel should really be careful of her line though, I didn't like some of her line like ""I'm the strongest"" and ""You didn't win because before you didn't have me"" duh. Also not gonna forget Hawkeye. To be honest, in Avengers I really didn't like Hawkeye because he's just a 'guy' with an arrow and just randomly showed up in any scene but actually he's character is so BADASS! Everything that we need, what we want is here.

Also I don't get it why some people can not accept that Thor is fat or treat him like a joke. I mean, this movie might be trying to give us a message about no matter what 'shape' are you, you can be a hero and save the world. To be honest, I like what they did to Thor, that man is depressed and taking the most responsible after he missed the shot to kill Thanos in Infinity War. Even though he already did killed him but it's not gonna bring back his people of Asgard. Also he's God of Thunder for god sake, he could slap his stomach with thunder and got his abs back.

I'm so happy too for Captain America. Finally he could do his dance with Peggy and I didn't expected that we could see the fight between Captain America with his own self. Also when Tony met his father really warm my heart, and we can see the 'real-life' Jarvis - I didn't expected that too.

When the whole superhero arrived it is so EPIC! The whole person in theater are screaming and shocked. Gives me a goosebumps and still left me speechless!

This movie is absolute perfection. The ending of this movie is we and the characters deserved. It gives a perfect balance for all these past 10 years. Epic and perfect ending, I was not disappointed at all. This movie was completely emotional and visually stunning. Now I get it why the Russo Brothers told us to do a Marvel Movie marathon before watching Endgame because this movie had everything to accomplish what left behind before all of this.

Ready or not, whatever it takes.

Go watch it for yourself.",0
1st hour and a half in I was ready for it toend so long and dragged out the last 30-45 mins made for good watching but that's it,1
Listen I'll take X-Men over the avengers any day. boring characters,1
"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.

On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.

Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.

Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.

Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10",0
"I have to say, my first reaction walking out of the cinema was that it was great. Probably an 8/10. You know there's so much fan service in this movie and I particularly loved the ""I can do this all day"" CA line from one CA to another. It was almost Toy Story 2, enlightened Buzz to naive Buzz banter.

I loved Clever Hulk, found Thor hilarious, though a bit annoying at times, and loved the references to past movies. Cap swinging Mjollnir around was beautiful.

The deaths in this movie were also pretty surprising but I agree with some of the more balanced reviews in here that it was bizarre that so much time was spent on Hawkeye - does anyone really care about him? Not really.

Killing off Black Widow was a surprising touch, but I, like many others, probably felt more of an emotional reaction to Banner's relationship with her and not Hawkeye (because no one actually cares about him). Renner, as an actor, just doesn't cut it much, unfortunately.

The real problem with End Game, is the time travel. I don't know why any movie franchise would ever want to deal with time travel knowing how much grief it creates. Sure they try to explain everything with their hilarious conversation about movies, but in the end, there are just too many questions left at the end of the day, particularly when they already try to explain it through the Ancient One.

The most glaring one of these is, if they change the past, they're changing another timeline, so how selfish is that? If Tony Stark snaps his fingers and kills Thanos, what happens to that original timeline? If he sent Thanos and everyone back, how does he magically know not to send Gamora back who is now stuck in 2023 - and so does that mean 2014 Quill never meets Gamora?!? What the hell? Essentially erasing the entire 2014 GOTG franchise in that universe. If Captain America goes back in time, he will inevitably change history in some way or another, so that is another timeline, right? So while everyone else's timeline is meant to stay the same in the present (as said by Stark) how does Cap end up sitting by the same lake as everyone else.

There are also way too many questions about new timelines created - but perhaps that is intentional, such as the Loki TV show. But this is why I hate it when they bring time travel into any movie and just add stuff to it to make it wrap up nicely in their own universe.

Also, don't get me started on how impossibly strong Thanos suddenly is without an infinity gauntlet? Even WITH the IG he couldn't stop Thor's Stormbringer, but now without the IG can easily defeat Thor with Stormbringer AND Mjollnir, Iron Man and Cap??? How convenient.

I also think Marvel made a serious mistake creating Captain Marvel, how is she brought in as a convenient deus ex machina and yet doesn't really stick around to show off all her abilities, and she can't even defeat Thanos single handedly? Pfft. That was rich. She can barely prevent Thanos from snapping his fingers, yet in Infinity War, Cap was able to actually hold off his hand too? Bizarre parallels.

So okay, sure, it was enjoyable to watch, but I just feel that there are too many plot inconsistencies creeping into End Game. There should have been better ways to get the infinity stones back, and I think someone stupid just thought time travel was the best way to do it,.",0
"This movie was a joke,average superhero movie where the heroes win and everyone's happy, hounestly zero dialogue this whole thing is just liked because marvel is ending, this movie made people ""cry""?really?the only thing that made me cry was my money I spent on seeing this garbage, thor was ruined along with hulk, thanks was dumber down,and capitain marvels horrible scenes were pain full to sit through,hounestly I'm glad people are coming to their senses and rating this movie lower now that they rewatch it, it's full of plot holes and the time travel is embarrassing lazy writing that's a disgrace to real time travel movies,besides the hype this movie had nothing it was 100% hypebased in fact I dont think anyone acctually paid attention to the movie, the ending was extremely predictable and the final battle was bland with the only background colors being brown and destroyed ships so disapointing after the amazing movie that showed that superhero movies can be more then saving the day and the bad guys losing",0
"1- Time machine = insane amount of plot holes 2- Unrealistic overpowered Thanos without the gems... illogical AF. 3- Characters decisions specially in Thanos combat were dump and had no logic. 4- Weak plot, it seems like the avenguers didn't learn anything from the past movies. 5- Too much forced drama and fillers. For me it´s a 5 star movie, but i gave 1 due the immense amount of 10´s.",0
"I can never be bothered with reviews but this films rating is beyond a joke. Plot is awkward and ridiculous... even for Marvel. Acting is non existent. Direction and editing just feels amateurish. I couldnt deal with anymore after the 1st hour it was excruciating. It feels like they gave a class of children the old ""how would you end the avengers"" lesson and just put all the answers in a bag and picked one.... and then just made it work.... or so they thought. I may feels the urge to watch the 1st half again and hope it inspires me to watch the conclusion but its highly doubtful.",0
It lacked many of the major events that we were wanting for,1
There are so many nonsense point in this movie. Wasted my 3hrs. I'm very very DISAPPOINTED.,1
It was extremely disappointing. Crammed every politically correct them down your throat.,1
What is this garbage? 3 hours of absolutely nothing but awful dialogue and boring misplaced fight scenes. Must be all the brainwashed Marvel fanboys who gave this movie a top rating...,0
Too many plot holes. The first 90 minutes were really slow. The next 90 minutes were too rushed. Infinity war was wayyyyy better.,0
Man what a let down after Infinity War. Virtually no action in a superhero movie. Predictable plot with lame time warping around all over the place. And what in God's name did you do with Thor's character after the last movie holy crap! So glad I didn't waste my time in a theater for this one.,0
"Just watched this in fast-forward. i simply cannot digest this universe where in one hand high tech space travel magic creatures are living along with dump low tech planetlings , so i guess that the majority of the fans are identifying them self to those lowlifes. and the most irritating for me is how low modern they dress them self in this marvel universe.",1
"I Have Watched Every Single Movie & Every Single TV Show... This Is Awful.

They Hyped This Up So Much Yet Was So",0
"This latest of the Avengers series is pretty predictable because it is so formulaic: a convoluted set of story strings that must come together at the end, gratuitous little interpersonal dramas, and lots and lots of explosions, fistfights, and a pseudo battle of Armageddon. Also, predictably, the final battle must invoke Deus ex machina to save the day.

It's too bad that a lot of engaging actors and Marvel characters are wasted on such an insipid, uninspiring script.

The God wannbe, Thanos, is a boring and not a terribly scary sci-fi villain. He looks like a World Wrestling Federation refugee who overdosed on steroids. And, the quest for the five magic stones that give power over the entire universe sounds like a gimmick straight out of an adolescent-level video game.

The first 60 minute takes forever to ramp-up. And the viewer is lost without remembering the previous installment,""Infinity War."" After a padded full three hours of superhero antics - so many superheroes I can't keep them straight - the ending is dismally anticlimactic. Killing off Iron Man seems terribly misplaced. And, just to drag out the boredom, it follows up with a painfully long shot of all the super heroes - clad in black - at a funeral that is, well, deadly.

A forgettable fractured sci-fi yarn.",0
"Please don't waste your time on this...Its very boring. It's like they pre-sell the movie with a good ending of infinity war. Its a rip off. Trust me you won't believe this. I quite after 30 minutes.

I am writing this review to alert people: keep your money and time for something else.",0
"I have watched the first part many, many times. Every minute of it was accounted for with importance to the plot - not wasted on snowflake emotions.

This second half has an excellent plot, but oh, my - how it dragged on with talk and tears!

I also didn't like Pepper suddenly being outfitted as a fighter?! lol! And, considering the future hero roles revealed in this one, can we eventually expect a white Black Panther, too?! Don't get me wrong - I don't want to see a white Black Panther.

Several other points of disappointment, too.

Bummer.",0
"This movie goes far far beyond the last season of Game of Thrones to become the worst expected thing of 2019. What a pain to me, what a waste of my time. Everything is just not what it should have been. Believe or not, the comedian Thor is the best thing in this movie. After putting second thought about the movie to write this review, I decided to rate it 1 instead of 2.",0
"What they did to Hulk and Thor was disgusting. The best action Hulk had was handing tacos to Antman. They turned him into taco Tuesday Hulk with no redemption or rematch for Thanos.

Fat alcoholic self pity Thor was not funny and for a demi god he turned out to be league bowler from crap town Ohio. Appalling and gross! Oh, support group Cap was another miss. They turned the women into men and the men into women straight up Hollywood style. 👎👎",0
"I haven't really been a fan of many of the marvel movies but gave this one a shot given all the hype. Total waste of three hours. The time travel, plot holes and cheesy death scenes all were too confusing. These movies have consistently pandered to its audiences and this one was no different. If anything it was worse.",1
"OMG! What have I just watched? Remake of Avengers: Infinity War?

The last installment of Avengers looks like another Infinity War with table turning (this time we won) and introduction of few new elements such as Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and time machine. The rest is pretty much the same: whole lot of super-heroes doing crash-smash-flash-zap-bang super-fictional thing we already seen in earlier Avengers. OK, have to admit CGI is awesome but if you strip that the result is below average movie to watch once and leave in archive (if you mistakenly bought disc).

Bottom line, I really don't see End Game as a ""Masterpiece"" just because it filled-up box office emerging on top of all movies. It is not something we have not seen before, no breakthrough, not better than Infinity War. Just good advertising boosted this up on hall of fame scale.",1
"I had to give this 1 star as it's not possible to give it less. Having avoided it at the Cinema because i knew it was a lost cause i finally watched it tonight...... Why does Thor have 2 functioning eyes? Having been told in Guardians of the galaxy that no one can hold an infinity stone and survive, suddenly everyone can now hold one? Where is the continuity in these films? Luckily this is the last we will ever see of this franchise! Until someone decides to do a remake as there are no original ideas anymore. J.J.Abrams you now have more films to ruin 👍🏻",0
I loved all the other movies..but I'm not sure I can even finish watching this...3hours of not getting to the damn point already...,1
"As a huge fan of marvel I can say that the characters I know and love that I expected to see in the grand finalé of a 22-movie saga, where nowhere to be found. Fat Thor was played off for jokes too much. Captain America was more Thor than actual Thor. Professor hulk was just a boring character. Thanos was nothing like how he was in the infinitely superior ""Infinity War"". Time travel rules was just cheap writing. An easy way out of a complex predicament crafted by two people with minimal creative abilities. The plot was littered with holes and just boring. This movie was not exciting. One of my biggest problems was the stupid one-liners and cheap jokes. This movie was not meant to be funny. There is room for humor, but there also needs to be room for plot and suspense and seriousness. Another of my biggest problems was cap lifting mjolnir. I have no problem with him lifting it. But it was anti-climactic. Good idea, but butchered in execution. I don't say this lightly or out of arrogance or vanity, but I, as a 15 year old kid could have created a better movie. Also, the greatest part of the film: Joe Russo got cast as the gay extra in his own movie.",1
"In the movie they say that the time travel will not affect the past?! How is that possible? Thor even stole the hammer from his past!!! He left him without a hammer!!!!

Hulk basically he didn't have any fight! He did not even got revenge from the last time he fought with thanos.

Captain Marvel could just have killed the Thanos without the stones all by herself!",0
"Endgame, The Flash (TV Series), and Legends of Tomorrow (TV Series) has many similarities and that bothers me the most. Felt like they stolen the idea & concept of time travel directly from The Flash story line. A big fan of Infinity War. It had original ideas and it was well executed. But I cannot say the same for Endgame.

My Rating 6/10",1
One of the best comic book movie villains was ruined. Who writes this thing? Time travel? Really? Result: Film full of plot holes. Unsatisfying deaths of main characters Tony and Natasha. Previously cool - now ruined characters Thor and Hulk. I feel like Thanos today.,0
"So I just waisted 5 precious minutes of my life. This superwoman character is absolutely not credible! Come on, she is not destructible, she has no limits, she can go light years in space and bring on her shoulders a whole spaceship back to earth...no, why make a whole movie, and involve and kill a bunch of other way cooler and believable characters on the way, when you can just use this, the one and only, incredible all-can-do woman and just finish the film in 5 minutes. It makes no sense what you people did there. Even Superman had his limits, and was vulnerable and felt real, we were glad to accept him as a hero, because he felt like one of us. But she, she is nothing like us, humans, so I just don't get it. Sorry, one star for this nonsensical thing you call Avengers: Endgame. And yes, my rating is based on 5 minutes watching, but it is like reading a book - if you don't like the first pages, you won't fall for the rest of it...",0
They've really scrapped the bottom with this one! Oh so Bad!,1
"I know the reviews say differently. But it sucked.

Could have been so much better.

So impossibly random that a malfunction would happen to let Thanos see the pasts future which is impossible even for superhero movie standards.

Plus if you had the all powerful hand you could have controlled the event and caused your not death. Just saying.

And why was it so easy to chop hand and head in one scene but then, So difficult to handle Thanos with more super power hero's at the ready??

Thor fat??? Just dumb, ruined the movie for me.

Part one was just so good and flowed so well.",0
If you are a 7 years old kid or you have a 7 years old mind you will love this movie ...,1
The movie is not even worth half the rating it has got! It should be 3 or 4,1
Seriously I am actually convinced now that nobody in the industry knows how to write an ending. they are so focused on leaving plot opening for a possible future opportunity that they cant give a satisfying ending! Game of thrones and the decline of Stranger things to mention a few.,0
"This movie was disappointing! It didn't make sense to kill off Thanos in the first 10 min of the movie.

The whole timeline opens up to many plot holes.

You can tell Captain a marvel was an afterthought. They literally had he on the movie for 15 min runtime!

This movie could have been saved if:

1. No Time Travel 2. More Captain Marvel 3. Less Grieving scenes, (We get it) 4. More Actjon!!!",0
"Terrible movie. I have never been a big fan, of Marvel and even less of MCU, but there were several good movies within that universe.... but this one as the Infinity Gauntlet, destroyed all.... No sense to talk about, the respect of the comic source.... but Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and many others involved on their comic origin of the characters has to be suffering in hell seeing how their creations were terribly undermined....... but just analizing from a cinematographic point of view, this film has a terrible argument, script, direction and very poor characters.... 2 hours of the film were not needed, and all the structure that were builded for this collapsed with this ending. Plot holes and nonsense everywhere.

This film represents what social media can do.... in a bad way. Stay away, if you can.",0
"How did they get this so wrong?

Absolute travesty, and possibly the most disappointed I've ever been with a movie.

Lately disappointment is a recurring theme, with a string of average or outright terrible ""blockbusters"".",0
It is getting very boring now. not realistic at all,1
"First 30 minutes everyone is moping around couldn't hang around for another 2 & a half hours to see overpaid morons do senseless acts. I am ashamed to contribute towards this movie's box office record.

PS: I am not a dumb merican who likes stupid action without a story. Disney has ruined movies no one will make quality movies anymore just idiotic superhero stuff.",0
"This is not even movie anymore, completely looks like commercial!",1
"I managed to watch 40 minutes of this crap, and then could not stand it any longer. You must be a true fan of Marvel Universe to see it until the end. If you are not, avoid - nothing makes sense in this utterly boring movie. Acting is really bad too. High-end special effects cannot save it.",0
Way to long of a movie probably could of cut an hour out of it and it wouldn't have made a difference. Probably one of the worst Avenger movies I've seen. Very slow to get to the point and it do not hold my interest or my husband's.,0
"I had to take several breaks, walk the dogs, play videogames and clean the house, while watching this absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical pile of rubbish and now afterwards, I'm asking myself why I put myself through such suffering. To what end. I guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could have spent on basically anything else and it would have been more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing I guess.",1
Captain America switched with lokki at some point in past and captain never returned. This was more like a soap than action movie.,1
Story not good .. that's way i don't like this type of move.,1
"I was so EXCITED to see this movie. After I saw it, I was like.... WhAT A PIECE OF GARBAGE!!! To me, this film and Infinity War felt like it was rushed of not see any extra scenes that we were so exited to see. This movie was ok, I mean like Time travel? Come on, I expected more from this director!",0
"I'm extremely disappointed as it didn't have any cheese in the film and the film simply wasn't British enough. Thor and Loki's lovely accents were the only redeeming qualities, the rest was just terrible as i had to sit through 3 entire hours of annoying barely understandable accents with no cheese to get my love balls stirring. Afterwards I had to have several pints of tea to cheer me up, don't waste your money on this Britons.",1
"It was a fairly entertaining film for the first couple of hours (probably worth a 6 or 7), with a few exceptions, - not least the abomination of making Thor a fat drunken slob. Then it slowly became apparent that this was all about shedding the old traditional heroes (as originally written) and replacing them with politically correct versions as per the recent trend. I'm sure it will appeal to enough millennials to make tons of money, but I suspect that this is where I get off. If the PC brigade want ethnic minority and female heroes, - why not create new ones instead of corrupting the original stories. Until they add a White (or Black) Widower, male Captain Marvel (as per the original stories) or a white panther, etc., for balance. Which, I'm guessing, is no time soon.",0
"This movie is so much childish. Whats wrong with you guys , i mean first thanos snap his fingers and then you guys did the same 😂 Is this some kind joke ?",0
