24 April 2019,raudafitriani,"There is no way that I could describe my emotions for this movie. I'm totally speechless. I haven't laughed (even cried) this much in Marvel movie or even in any movie. I'm fully on my emotion, there are so many tears of joy and loss. Amazing story, the acting is outstanding, epic action, great CGI, the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie, amazing performance. I love it more than 3000.

Happiness, sadness, pure joy, excitement... I'm gonna miss this moment in my whole life because let's face it- it's been awhile movies can bring such a big enthusiasm like this.

It is such an experience you'll gonna remember it forever. People are clapping, laughing, crying, full of a state emotion. It's 3 hours long but it went by like a finger snapping by Thanos, and now I'm thinking I'm actually in Quantum Realm because it felt like 5 seconds. Even though you know where the story is gonna bring you because it's still a 'superhero movie' but it left me speechless. It's not just a superhero movie, it's more than that.

**SPOILER ALERT**

Even some characters that you didn't like before, you will love them in this movie. Like Captain Marvel. I didn't like her before in her own movie but in Endgame they showed how powerful, how strong and how capable she really is. And now I kinda love her! But Marvel should really be careful of her line though, I didn't like some of her line like ""I'm the strongest"" and ""You didn't win because before you didn't have me"" duh. Also not gonna forget Hawkeye. To be honest, in Avengers I really didn't like Hawkeye because he's just a 'guy' with an arrow and just randomly showed up in any scene but actually he's character is so BADASS! Everything that we need, what we want is here.

Also I don't get it why some people can not accept that Thor is fat or treat him like a joke. I mean, this movie might be trying to give us a message about no matter what 'shape' are you, you can be a hero and save the world. To be honest, I like what they did to Thor, that man is depressed and taking the most responsible after he missed the shot to kill Thanos in Infinity War. Even though he already did killed him but it's not gonna bring back his people of Asgard. Also he's God of Thunder for god sake, he could slap his stomach with thunder and got his abs back.

I'm so happy too for Captain America. Finally he could do his dance with Peggy and I didn't expected that we could see the fight between Captain America with his own self. Also when Tony met his father really warm my heart, and we can see the 'real-life' Jarvis - I didn't expected that too.

When the whole superhero arrived it is so EPIC! The whole person in theater are screaming and shocked. Gives me a goosebumps and still left me speechless!

This movie is absolute perfection. The ending of this movie is we and the characters deserved. It gives a perfect balance for all these past 10 years. Epic and perfect ending, I was not disappointed at all. This movie was completely emotional and visually stunning. Now I get it why the Russo Brothers told us to do a Marvel Movie marathon before watching Endgame because this movie had everything to accomplish what left behind before all of this.

Ready or not, whatever it takes.

Go watch it for yourself."
25 April 2019,ahmetkozan,"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.

On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.

Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.

Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.

Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10"
26 April 2019,theroo200182,"I have to say, my first reaction walking out of the cinema was that it was great. Probably an 8/10. You know there's so much fan service in this movie and I particularly loved the ""I can do this all day"" CA line from one CA to another. It was almost Toy Story 2, enlightened Buzz to naive Buzz banter.

I loved Clever Hulk, found Thor hilarious, though a bit annoying at times, and loved the references to past movies. Cap swinging Mjollnir around was beautiful.

The deaths in this movie were also pretty surprising but I agree with some of the more balanced reviews in here that it was bizarre that so much time was spent on Hawkeye - does anyone really care about him? Not really.

Killing off Black Widow was a surprising touch, but I, like many others, probably felt more of an emotional reaction to Banner's relationship with her and not Hawkeye (because no one actually cares about him). Renner, as an actor, just doesn't cut it much, unfortunately.

The real problem with End Game, is the time travel. I don't know why any movie franchise would ever want to deal with time travel knowing how much grief it creates. Sure they try to explain everything with their hilarious conversation about movies, but in the end, there are just too many questions left at the end of the day, particularly when they already try to explain it through the Ancient One.

The most glaring one of these is, if they change the past, they're changing another timeline, so how selfish is that? If Tony Stark snaps his fingers and kills Thanos, what happens to that original timeline? If he sent Thanos and everyone back, how does he magically know not to send Gamora back who is now stuck in 2023 - and so does that mean 2014 Quill never meets Gamora?!? What the hell? Essentially erasing the entire 2014 GOTG franchise in that universe. If Captain America goes back in time, he will inevitably change history in some way or another, so that is another timeline, right? So while everyone else's timeline is meant to stay the same in the present (as said by Stark) how does Cap end up sitting by the same lake as everyone else.

There are also way too many questions about new timelines created - but perhaps that is intentional, such as the Loki TV show. But this is why I hate it when they bring time travel into any movie and just add stuff to it to make it wrap up nicely in their own universe.

Also, don't get me started on how impossibly strong Thanos suddenly is without an infinity gauntlet? Even WITH the IG he couldn't stop Thor's Stormbringer, but now without the IG can easily defeat Thor with Stormbringer AND Mjollnir, Iron Man and Cap??? How convenient.

I also think Marvel made a serious mistake creating Captain Marvel, how is she brought in as a convenient deus ex machina and yet doesn't really stick around to show off all her abilities, and she can't even defeat Thanos single handedly? Pfft. That was rich. She can barely prevent Thanos from snapping his fingers, yet in Infinity War, Cap was able to actually hold off his hand too? Bizarre parallels.

So okay, sure, it was enjoyable to watch, but I just feel that there are too many plot inconsistencies creeping into End Game. There should have been better ways to get the infinity stones back, and I think someone stupid just thought time travel was the best way to do it,."
8 August 2019,sourabh_sarma,"Tone,pacing, character arcs, plot holes, emotional connect, logical depth,story,cgi,propagandas,Plot convenience,lazy writing.Overrated, Overhyped fan service cashgrab."
14 August 2019,ckmatt-77267,"Watched last evening on Blu-Ray and was quite disappointed. Should have streamed it for a lot less. What in the world is going on with the writers and producers these days. Plot was weak at best. Time Paradox was poorly done. Character development bordered on the ridiculous. Thor was made into a bumbling drunk idiot, Hulk was....I don't know, some kind of a cross between Banner/Hulk working in a diner, and was nearly useless like in Infinity Wars, Captain American now has and can wields Thors' hammer. What in the world is going on! This unfortunate change started surface with Infinity Wars. They also made sure all the politically correct stuff was jammed right in there. The first two remain the best, don't even bother with the others. Sad!!"
15 July 2019,singh_nyc,"This was probably one of the worst movie I have seen, even on the Marvel scale. How can they take so many talented actors and make this non-sense? I laughed every time emotional drama came. Instead of tears, I was was feeling pity for myself. I hope this is really the endgame. But I doubt."
9 August 2019,loocsinatas,"-spoilers!-

-Iron man had to go talk to his dad in the past, Thor had to talk to his mom, Hawkeye got to go see his old dead girlfriend.. How convenient that all the stones were in the past directly next to the main characters loved ones. Nobody had to go hundreds of years in the past or anything? Nope all the stones were just a generation away hanging out with your parents so you could go reconnect with them and get emotional.

-Tons of plot holes with time travel. We were told it creates a split in the timeline when they time travel, creating a whole new timeline. Sooo.. What happened to the old timeline they left behind to go back in time to defeat Thanos? Does this mean there is a timeline where all the superheroes abandoned the world to go back in time? And at the end when Captain America went back in time, shouldn't it have created a new timeline for him as well? Instead of him being able to meet up with them when he was old? Although this doesn't bother me as much as the other point of this review, it did make the story feel a little hollow and vague.

-Felt like there was only 1 single battle sequence in this movie. Aren't there usually a few smaller battles before the final epic one? It was like 2.5 hours of drama and feelings and ""oh I miss my mom"" and only about 12 minutes of good fighting. The fighting was also so cut up, trying to give every hero a great cameo, that no fight scene lasted longer than 10 seconds without being cut. Even after Iron man gives Thanos a long pre-fight speech it only shows about 2 seconds of fighting before they cut away.

-They kill Thanos in the beginning super easily, no effort, kinda upsetting. This made the entire previous movie feel like a waste. (even though it was a much better movie)

-The Hulk made me cringe. They've changed his character so drastically he's not even the hulk anymore. He doesn't get angry, he doesn't regenerate (either does Captain in this movie), he doesn't smash. He's always in green form. They explain all of the above with, oh I shot myself with some gamma rays. THEN LATER WHEN HE PUTS ON THE GLOVE THEY SAY THE HULK IS PRETTY MUCH IMMUNE TO GAMMA RAYS?! Ugh. He also mentions how he was trying to fight the hulk, but then he realized the hulk is the cure. What is he the cure to if he cant regenerate anymore? I miss the old Edward Norton Hulk to be completely honest.

-Personally, I hated Captain Marvel. I hate the actor, I hate the character, I hate her vague god like powers, I hate how she randomly shows up in this movie even though she wasn't in any of the others. I hate how she only shows up for a few minutes in the beginning and a few seconds at the end.

-Literally the best scene in the movie is at the very end, when Thor and StarLord are arguing about who's in charge of the ship."
7 June 2019,esraamajed,"I feel they ran out of ideas, and BANG time machine is the solution. They should have prepared themselves for the end before that. for example in sherlock holmes "" the series"" they prepared for the season final ""the Final Problem"",, 2 seasons before it, saying words or giving hints that something is going to happen. I was really disappointed with this movie."
4 August 2019,hphatngo,There are so many nonsense point in this movie. Wasted my 3hrs. I'm very very DISAPPOINTED.
18 June 2019,louis-170,One of the best comic book movie villains was ruined. Who writes this thing? Time travel? Really? Result: Film full of plot holes. Unsatisfying deaths of main characters Tony and Natasha. Previously cool - now ruined characters Thor and Hulk. I feel like Thanos today.
28 May 2019,stomes85,"What they did to Hulk and Thor was disgusting. The best action Hulk had was handing tacos to Antman. They turned him into taco Tuesday Hulk with no redemption or rematch for Thanos.

Fat alcoholic self pity Thor was not funny and for a demi god he turned out to be league bowler from crap town Ohio. Appalling and gross! Oh, support group Cap was another miss. They turned the women into men and the men into women straight up Hollywood style. 👎👎"
24 April 2019,SharkByteAudioProductions,"This is probably the highest 8/10 I could give for an 8/10 movie.

There are some very good moments in Endgame and that's coming from a long standing MCU fan growing up with these movies. In creating an extensive and emotional journey for a lot of the MCU characters, it absolutely succeeds.

Endgame ultimately is an excellent conclusion to over 10 years of film but I feel the plot's pacing and direction is really lacking to Infinity War, which 'trimmed the fat' and was much more focused and energetic. Granted, Endgame takes risks but this might be a disappointment to some fans with its slower pace that focuses on character development over action and intense sequences. The run time probably should be shorter or streamlined. Less cuts and motion blur during fight scenes would've made it easier to track fights as well.

Respect for the Russo Brothers for taking the direction they did with Endgame and it really does satisfy but Infinity War is overall a more entertaining movie. It's not the best MCU movie but I can't dispute its great conclusion."
11 June 2019,javadtnabadi,"They cant kill the main charectors, just learn from got."
11 August 2019,006_donny,"I had no choice but to watch it to finish the sequence. The worst of all the Avengers movies. Apart from some action scenes all the rest it is pure lame dialogues and poor performances. Purely made to make money out of a ""trendy"" public that are rating this movie high because I've never met one single person who has read the comics and like this garbage. At least, there will be no more of this, I hope."
7 August 2019,philippepack,"And that's the best part of the movie ... I had my doubts about the Russo brothers, but now I know. Stop making movies, please ..."
19 August 2019,Drat1964,"As others have said time travel is always a cop out, but there seem to be some major problems with it's use here, first is the fates of black widow and gamora, we are told (by the writer in the bluray commentary) that black widow can't be brought back because the fate of obtaining the soul stone can't be undone, yet gamora seems to have undone here fate from the same choice. The small point that if gamora never made the choice due to the time travel, then in fact none of the events in the previous could never have happened as Thanos would have been one stone short seems to be ignored. Then you have Captain America's fate, he time travels back and lives out his days as agents Carters secret husband, cool. Unfortunately this then means that within the MCU universe He also has a reactionship with agent 13, technically his own great niece, whoops."
5 July 2019,gurpreetsingh-23756,"I do not like marvel films, because forced comedy is not how you make films. I liked infinity war because of thanks, a very decent villian. When comes to endgame, it is a fraud, emotions without reasons and are they not the avengers, they avenge. Right! I saw the trailer and thought this is gonna be a film where avengers are gonna shine. But all that suit up, training was for time travel to see their younger selves and parents. An 8 year old will be able to write that outline. By far the biggest disappointment by marvel, it has turned itself into the new transformers franchise. The only thing they are better at apart from the money is, paying off critics and websites to mislead by positive reviews."
1 August 2019,mike_moor,"If you like special effects then you will like this movie. If you like a good, intriguing, believable story with interesting characters then this movie may be very lacking in that department. The characters with all their interesting super powers just seemed to be a bore. Perhaps this sort of thing happens when you have too many main characters in one movie. There is no character development. One thing there is no shortage of is good looking special effects but it merely covers up the inadequacy of any kind of substance in the story lines and characters.

The story totally contradicts itself. I'm not going to post spoilers in this review but in the end it really looked like the writers just made up unrealistic stuff that did not make any sense or had any sort of believable realism. If you tell a story like a 3 year old, other 3 year olds are going to love your story but adults are going to be bored to tears.

They turned almighty Thor into a 3 year old, with mannerisms, intellect and all the traits 3 year olds display. But here we go again with Hollywood trying to emasculate men in all their latest block busters. Political nonsense that seems to be infecting and infesting big budget movies... It really just makes the world of Hollywood look all the more plastic.

Perhaps the extremely high rating of this movie made me expect something really good and entertaining but all the enthusiasm I had soon turned in boredom and mild resentment because 3 hours is a lot to spend on something that seemed to bring only boredom."
7 June 2019,circellic,It was extremely disappointing. Crammed every politically correct them down your throat.
3 June 2019,WebHead62,"I want to start out saying I love all the Marvel movies leading up to Endgame. I loved Infinity War because it seemed to be setting up a terrific conclusion to the original 6 Avengers story arc's. I was very wrong. Let's start with Tony's Arc. In Ironman 1 Tony is told you are a man who has everything and nothing. In Ironman 2 we find out his dad was distant and cold to him, and in ironman 3 he is getting panic attacks because he thinks it's up to him to save the world from all threats. So in Endgame he finally gets everything that's important. He becomes a Dad and husband and... was proven right by having to die saving the universe himself? Why? Because we are supposed to believe Tony can't retire? Of course he can. Didn't he say to Steve in AoU ""isn't that why we fight so we can end the fight? So we can go home?"" Tony wanted to retire. Tony's arc should have been about being a good dad like his father never was and finally becoming the man who has everything important. He should have learned that he doesn't have to do it all on his own. Team work should have won the final battle. What's the point of finally getting all the Avengers together if it's left to one man to sacrifice himself to save everyone? Tony's ending was not satisfying and it was not the end they have been building towards from the beginning. Now let's talk about the real tragedy in this movie. Steve Rogers character. We know he is a good man who always does what he believes is right. He calls Home the Avengers facility and says he can't ignore a situation that's headed south. He loved Peggy but found out she had gotten married and had a happy life and he tried moving on with her niece. This storyline was ignored which was ok because most of Steves storyline in the MCU has been about saving Bucky. You remember him right? Steve didn't seem to for the entire movie. Instead of thinking about Sam and Bucky and all the people they are going to save if their plan works when they find Thanos in the beginning of Endgame Steve's just looking at the Peggy compass that he hasn't looked at in at least 3 movies. Why? So we can all forget about his actual character development and think it's a great ending when he goes back in time to be with Peggy. I'm just going to ignore all the plot holes associated with Steve going back in time and just focus on the character assasination this commits. This means the same guy who says he can't ignore a situation headed south, who never ran away from a fight, who said I'm with you till the end of the line"" to Bucky is just going to live out his life in the past never saving his friend from being a brain washed assassin, never saving his other friends parents from being killed by his best friend, never stopping any of the thousands of bad things he would know are going to happen? That's not Steve. The writers never let Steve get a personal life. He never found someone after Peggy and he never had anything except the Avengers. He was the one that was set up to die. The final battle starts with what is probably the most epic scene in comic book movie history but fizzles our soon after. Doctor Stranges plan makes no sense. How was this the only way they could win? Why couldn't Captain Marvel snap? Why couldn't captain Marvel just fly the gauntlet to another galaxy? Why couldn't Doctor Strange open a portal and drop the gauntlet on some random planet? In Infinity War why didn't Doctor Strange use his portal to go to Wakanda and tell Thor to aim for the head. The characters powers were very inconsistent for the first time in the MCU. Why was Thanos with no infinity stones able to fight Mjolnir and Storm Breaker but Thanos with all 6 stones would have lost to Storm Breaker if Thor would have just aimed for the head? Why can Captain Marvel fly through a huge spaceship 10 times but she gets knocked out after one punch from Thanos? Why does no one attack Thanos at the same time as someone else? Where's the big team up? You would think getting everyone together for the first time would have been the only way to defeat Thanos, but you'd be wrong because it's all about Tony stark. Even Steve picking up Mjolnir means nothing really because it has no affect on the end of the battle. Thor and Steve could be taken out of this movie and nothing would change. They do nothing of importance. This movie seems so disconnected from Infinity War that it's boggles my mind how this movie has the same writers and directors as Infinity War and it was filmed at the same time as Infinity War. How can you get one so wrong and the other so right? It seems clear to me that the writers and directors decided that Tony was dying and Steve was going back to the past no matter how much their story suffered from doing it. It's like they had a check list of things to put in the movie without actually making a good story that fit in with the rest of their movies. This is by far the most dissapointing ending to anything I've ever looked forward to."
6 August 2019,bizlats,"What have they done wrong with this movie ""everything"" They have turned Thor & Hulk into joke characters the whole movie feels hurried and confusing the CGI is poor on more than one occasion a lot of MCU characters are more cameos than necessary.I enjoyed the early Marvel movies but the most recent ones are ruining the franchise how they made so much £££ out of this is baffling it only gets more confusing the longer you watch it.I am not sure why so many cameos were necessary as Captain Marvel was all that was needed."
6 August 2019,escape30-553-657408,"So many others have captured how I felt about this movie, that regurgitating what they said would lessen their impact. So all I want to say is that this movie was slow, disjointed, badly executed in writing and a complete disappointment. Even my 9 year old grandson said it sucked. Sad...."
14 August 2019,camperswag,"I cant believe people think this is 8.8, in a normal world this film is around 6, Infinity war is around 7, and some teenagers watch this at the cinemas and no one remembers it after a month."
10 July 2019,FilmMan47,"Seriously how did this junk made so much money is beyond me are people really crazy they don't know what they have done,this film is pure nonsense,and i hate to say this Thanos was a total looser here also what happened to hulk its a shame people will realise this in future that what a load of crap nonsense this was a total waste of time and money,it should have not even made 50 bucks at box office that's how bad this is,Scarlet Johannson was sacrificed in this mess just so people can shed a tear and throw money at the screen ,this makes me wonder the makers and people really enjoyed killing her black widow and iron man for cash ,both of them are dead now.,besides that this film is contagious cesspool of bad Cgi ,horrible cheesy Dialogs and Cartoonish action,and they say this can match avatar 2009 avatar was a masterpiece holds great repeat value then this any day,endgame holds no value as a film at all forget about repeat value,how is this a film it does not even qualifies for direct to Disc DVD Or hallmark movie,i feel like this is a bad joke its so bad that you cannot even tell it to yourself alone my rating is 1/10.skip it do not waste your time and money on this the whole world already wasted."
3 September 2019,StarTwin82,"I can't believe we just sat and watched this movie. There are a million different problems with this movie. Be advised we have watched all of the other Marvel movies, and have begun watching them over again with our children, and we feel totally disappointed with this last installment. I could go on forever on how it doesn't make any sense and is so disjointed... Spoilers ahead. 1. Why were there no paradoxes with the amount of interaction Thor had with his mom, Tony Stark had with his dad, and Captain America had with himself? Even Nebula met herself and then killed herself...Why didn't it impact or change anything in the future? 2. How come Tony Starks' daughter still exists if Thanos didn't get a chance to kill everyone in the first place? Wouldn't that negate the other off shoot time period? 3. How come Gamora was alive for a moment,(she lost her life due to Thanos in Infinity War) but Black Widow (who lost her life as a part of the same ritual)was dead dead? Never to return again?

Other troubles:

4. How come selfish Hawkeye gets a happy ending with his family after he killed his friend, and also went on a killing rampage prior to getting everything back? 5. Why did they ruin Thor and Hulk? They made Hulk the ""smart hulk"". He was straight up annoying. Thor was plain out childish. Why does the chosen ruler of Asgard, choose not to rule Asgard, and instead gives the job to Valkyrie, if not to merely push the feminine agenda and female power movement we are currently in? 6. Why did they make all the females go up against the army, alone at one point during the battle without males? Again, it felt like a commercial. 7. Assuming Captain America stayed in the past implies that there are two Captain America's in that same timeline. Eventually, it would cross over to the time when Captain America unfreezes. This would imply he is living his life in secret with Agent Carter, but then that doesn't make sense, because the old Captain America ends up on that bench in the ending timeline in an old man's jacket. 8. How come Captain Marvel doesn't age? She has been the same age since the 1990's. This wasn't explained in the movie. Although not a big concern, but something to note. 9. How come all the characters had no depth to them whatsoever, even those we have come to know and love? They were all one note and disjointed. None of them acted in the same way they had in previous movies. There are many more plot holes and disappointing elements, but these are the ones that primarily stood out. I realize it has been explained away by saying there are multiple timelines, however the multiple timelines argument, will not give me back the three hours we wasted by watching this movie. We really hoped it would get better as time went on, only to find out it was about to get worse. So disappointing!! A big let down."
31 August 2019,mrbwade,"I Have Watched Every Single Movie & Every Single TV Show... This Is Awful.

They Hyped This Up So Much Yet Was So"
29 August 2019,davish_wulf-1,"Spoiler alert, so read at your own risk. I though the latest title couldn't get much worse, until I watched Endgame. Again, a movie that looks like a computer game, this time since the script failed to innovate, it goes back to the previous movies ""Back to the future"" style. A fat Thor playing Fortnite, a Mjornir that any bloke can use, including the strange duck face Captain ""never gets his suit right"" Strangelip. A captain that gets old and delivers his shield to the flying ""never had an impact role"" birdie. An intelligent nerdy Hulk who lost all his grace (a green Mark Ruffalo on steroids and that's it). The list goes on and on, starting slooooow in the beginning to end in the yet again climax of the ""playmobil-bring the action man and all the transformers"" battle in the end, with depressing results and laughable deaths. Bring the wife and put her on an iron man suit, hell bring the smurfs, the ""useless on this flick"" Black Panther and friends, Popeye and your dog if you want. This is trash ""cinema"" in the making. let's skeese the money-cow with poor scripting, terrible CGI and ruin every child's fantasy regarding what is what and whom is whom on the ""Marvel"" universe. Marvel, you were sold to Disney, get ready for your next princesses, easy jokes and death of your child heroes."
10 June 2019,gorgos19,"I don't mind long movies, but they should be interesting. The story of this one could have been written by any 10 year old. What are story-writers getting paid for these days?"
7 June 2019,aydinibooo,Wow very cool. Time travel? Literally the laziest plot ever
1 August 2019,anssam-84084,"Endgame, The Flash (TV Series), and Legends of Tomorrow (TV Series) has many similarities and that bothers me the most. Felt like they stolen the idea & concept of time travel directly from The Flash story line. A big fan of Infinity War. It had original ideas and it was well executed. But I cannot say the same for Endgame.

My Rating 6/10"
14 August 2019,madsbugge,What is this garbage? 3 hours of absolutely nothing but awful dialogue and boring misplaced fight scenes. Must be all the brainwashed Marvel fanboys who gave this movie a top rating...

21 June 2019,calebdrums,"This is a movie where one term could be used to describe it, and that term is ""tedium."" I've always had a begrudging attitude towards Avengers movies because, as with a lot of entries in the MCU, it's a lot of scientific nonsense with the action thrown in as an afterthought in order to justify its existence as a superhero movie. But I thought I would give Endgame a fair chance. After all, having all those superheroes on one screen should be fun, action packed, and entertaining, right? Wrong.

I cannot express how terrible this film was. The two redeemable parts were Tony Stark's daughter and Ant-Man. They were the only entertaining parts of the film. I pay money to see movies that are entertaining, not ones that are so full of characters that you get lost.

There are a lot of reasons that I hated this movie, but I'm going to focus on two in particular here: the story and the action, or rather, the lack of action. First, the story. This entire film was built around a needlessly complicated plot surrounding time travel, even though the time travel was completely pointless in the first place. Bruce Banner says, point blank, that traveling back into the past won't change the future. So, why do you do it, then? Why on Earth would you commit to such an exercise in complete futility? I'll tell you why, because you need more science fodder for all the Marvel super fans, so that they can leave the theater and point at someone who looks confused and feel superior.

Everything was poorly written in this movie. When your forced obscenities are being spouted from the mouths of the people you're supposed to cheer for, while your villain speaks in Shakespearean soliloquies, then you've clearly gone completely wrong with your script. Also, the part where Stark's daughter swears and we were supposed to find it cute? Yeah, I didn't. I found it grossly inappropriate and wrong to show a 4 or 5 year old child in such a manner. It wasn't innocent and sweet, it was rather demented. Meanwhile, Thanos speaks in these long, grandiloquent speeches that never seem to have an end. It was all just one big pile of dreck.

Thanos was another problem I had with this film. His motivations were never properly spelled out. They tried, but they failed rather miserably. It seemed like he just wanted to destroy the world because it was ripe for the taking, I guess? I don't know. He was weird as well, because he said he was going to build another universe, but he seemed to have a nihilistic outlook on everything, so that would mean his other universe would be completely pointless. Anyway, it was really terrible.

But this movie's main sin was its lack of action through the first two-thirds, and the fact that it hardly showed the Avengers doing anything heroic. They never stopped a bank robbery, they never helped an assault victim, all they did was do their pointless time travel stuff to attempt to stop Thanos, even though Bruce said it would be completely futile to do so. The movie couldn't get out of its own way and it suffered because of it.

Then the last third was all action and it blew my mind, but not in a good way. I left the theater with a physical headache due to the poor pacing and cinematography on the final battle sequences. They were overly long, started and stopped way too many times, and attempted to tie up every loose end from the entire MCU in one big bang. It was just terrible! You have to allow things to flow, and this movie didn't flow at all.

A movie that was boring, poorly paced, poorly written, and just a terrible excuse for film definitely deserves a spot on my worst of 2019 list. Hopefully, Toy Story 4 makes up for it!"
20 May 2019,greg-04082,"Too bad there isn't a zero star rating. I am not the target demo, was dragged to the movie theater by my young son to see it (he thought the movie was OK. I didn't.

1. Lots of nothing much happens 2. Lots of melodramatic music 3. The movie at 182 minutes is about 82 minutes too long 4. The Thor character ceases to become comic amusement about a third through the pic 5. Incomprehensible and repeated fight scenes 6. Exceptionally poor dialog in the screenplay

Visually the only star turns were Brie Larson and Elizabeth Olsen. The Scarlet Witch, one of the stronger themes was barely in this - Olsen should get her own movie.

I was three hours of my life back plus $68 bucks spent on tickets and popcorn at AMC."
7 June 2019,tiwanaks,I watch probably 1 movie on an average every week from last 3 years and have watched a lot of boring movies but this is the first time I could not watch a movie to the end Can't be more boring movie then this
20 May 2019,joeymcguire-28203,Not sure what all the fuss is about. It's no way an all-time top ten film
20 August 2019,callepoo,"This movie was a complete mess, after all the years of build up, I didn't care. It was like putting an entire smörgåsbord into a very small bowl. All the flavours and textures blended and lost their appeal. Only two characters stood out, Thor and Antman."
5 June 2019,britishcheeseboard,"I'm extremely disappointed as it didn't have any cheese in the film and the film simply wasn't British enough. Thor and Loki's lovely accents were the only redeeming qualities, the rest was just terrible as i had to sit through 3 entire hours of annoying barely understandable accents with no cheese to get my love balls stirring. Afterwards I had to have several pints of tea to cheer me up, don't waste your money on this Britons."
14 May 2019,dekadent,"Endgame is a much less interesting and visually engaging movie than Infinity War. I don't understand all the crazy hype and 8.8 on imdb is stupid, this is why I'm giving it one star, to mitigate the stupidity.

As everyone expected, remaining avengers use time travel to try to fix things, yet even for a marvel movie the time travel science is confusing and ridiculous, as well as shown in a very boring way. I've seen low budget movies that had better grasp on the scientific, logical and visual aspect of time travel.

The whole point of endgame is to resurrect the fallen avengers and other trillions of creatures across the galaxy, yet while doing it avengers end up losing irrevocably even more important members of the team, and the whole thing looks ill-conceived.

A lot of time is spent on meaningless conversations, while the devastation Thanos caused across the galaxy is barely shown, negating the past and current sacrifices of avengers.

I left Infinity War wanting to see how the story ends. I left Endgame feeling that I should've waited for it to come out on Netflix."
16 June 2019,captainobvious-39324,"Can't believe how long this film was, it was far too long and far too spread out. The characters were overly simplistic and there was too much action scenes for the characters to really develop and show off their personalities. After the film I could barely get up it really made me and my lovely Mother's backsides very sore after sitting down for over 3 hours at once. Not only is this film immensely overrated but it hurts people's bums as well!"
19 May 2019,egg_egan,"Last week I wasted 3 hours of my life watching the latest Avengers movie End Game. I am a massive Marvel fan and have loved most of the movies up to now. Lots of action and fun. What has gone wrong. I was looking forward to this film so much but was so disappointed. If you want action and fun go watch John Wick 3, Wow that is a film especially compared to this dribble.

Were do I start. At the start, or should I say for the first 30 min all the characters are depressed and feeling sorry for themselves. Then they mention time travel, yes time travel. I mean after all Marvels great films and ideas the best they could come up with to get things back to normal was time travel. What next, Ironman (Robert Downey Jr) wakes up back in Ironman 1 and the last 20 years have all been a dream aka Dallas style. Come on give me a break the best they could come up with was time travel. Anyway 1 1/2 hours into the film I turned to my friend and said the last 1 1/2 hours must be amazing as this has been so boring and all the reviews say this is a great movie. To my disappointment it did not get much better. In the 3 hours of running time there is at a push 30 minutes of action and that is at a push. The rest is just a load of rubbish.

So disappointed, won't be wasting my hard earned money on Marvel again."
27 May 2019,sst-91208,Endgame was hands down the worst entry in the Marvel cinematic universe. I've had random bouts of depression ever since i saw this film. It ruined so many of the films that preceded it i have no words. Zero stars if i could.
20 May 2019,bunsen2019,"The last Avengers ended with a philosophically valid dilemma. Stop the overpopulation of all worlds by halving the population in the universe in order to save humans and other species. The only mention of environment in Endgame was Captain America stating ""a pod of whales was seen in the Hudson, if you want to look at the bright side"" to which Black Widow replies ""I will throw this sandwich at you"". Yup, that's as deep as that conversation went. Immediately they were back to the tired old 'save humanity from evil Thanos' plot. The world is portrayed as a complete shambles with Thanos' reduced population measures. It would have been far more interesting to show the positive changes of having fewer people in the richness of the planet, thriving of other species as well as our own. But no, that is completely ignored and the ecosystem crushing population returns. Very generic plot, disappointing."
6 August 2019,lelah-26453,"I have been anxiously awaiting the option to buy and watch this at home because I didn't make it to the theater, I was crazy excited when it finally popped up in my Roku feed. I cancelled my night and ran to the store to grab snacks and start it right away. It went weird and somehow lost my attention almost immediately, took about 100 rewinds to get through it fully because I kept ending up more interested in my phone. Slow motion with plot hole upon plot hole upon plot hole, I don't think anybody other than children who just like superheroes could enjoy this, due frankly to just how stupid it is. Probably not even children, because it's mostly a soap opera. After I finally finished it I watched it again the next day, out of confusion, because I thought I must have missed major parts. I didn't, it's really just not good. I'm trying to think of my favorite part and I can't even think of anything, just the negatives. I liked when Thor's lightning burst styled his hair and braided his beard for him? Above all of my other issues...After three hours of working toward the galaxy's survival, Captain America is going to take the self-serving route? Stupid. Disagree all you want about his grief, mental state, and love for Black Widow, but Hawk-Eye isn't about to throw himself over a cliff and potentially leave his kids fatherless when the only reason he's there is to get them back. Stupid. These two complaints have already made me too irritated to want to list anymore; THE MOVIE IS BAD and that's all you need to know."

22 June 2019,grasovec,"I am huge sf lover but i never liked hollywood superhero movies except maybe (nolan batman trilogy) because there is no suspense when you know in advance who will win. would you like to watch football match knowing the result in advance?

secondly i don't like this ""back to the past"" cheat card. so every time you end up dead or don't like the outcome you can go into past undo things, bring dead back to life and change the present. so basically ""endgame"" isn't the end, if ""bad"" guys also can also travel back in time? ok, i know this film targeted teenager audience and cannot be to dark or too complex (like real life is). film was fun, but it would be much better if they didn't use this lame trick going into past after half of the characters ended up dead in previous film."

11 June 2019,veto-55008,"Just watched this in fast-forward. i simply cannot digest this universe where in one hand high tech space travel magic creatures are living along with dump low tech planetlings , so i guess that the majority of the fans are identifying them self to those lowlifes. and the most irritating for me is how low modern they dress them self in this marvel universe."
17 August 2019,vandykeu,"Endgame is a great popcorn action movie to ""finish"" a saga of popcorn action movies. This isn't serious entertainment and shouldn't be considered as such, and it reminds me of how George Lucas made Star Wars as an homage to the cheap serials like Flash Gordon. Especially as comic-sourced material, this is what the MCU is. Some part of me is actually a bit pained to like it as much as I do, given that it is just playing on base emotions to make money for a massive conglomerate like Disney.

BUT... what a great way to end several major storylines that they invested in over the past 11 years. For people who have watched the saga, I feel like this is just the cherry on the top. My only complaint is something that you can't really get away from in superhero stories: the character ""powers"" are totally inconsistent from scene to scene, and movie to movie. This is a trope that there's no getting away from, because if characters like Captain Marvel, Thor, Scarlet Witch, and Hulk were always as powerful as they show flashes of, then the story wouldn't even be a thing. Any one of them could destroy Thanos in the blink of an eye, and have done similar feats in other stories (and even in other scenes within a given story). That they sometimes ""reduce"" their power to a lower level, without an explained mechanism, is pretty laughable, and makes some parts of the story a bit nonsensical. Yes, this constant Ex Machina is needed to maintain the drama and keep the plot going, but it's still something that takes me out of the story.

What I really love about this movie, and the saga as a whole, is how good it is at developing the actual characters and their relationships. There are some similarities, but nobody is the same, and most of the arcs are believable. Thor's story, and apparent PTSD, is to me the best-done, but all of the majors (and some of the minors) are almost as good. I believed them. And for a popcorn action movie saga based on a comic series, I think that's a pretty high compliment."
7 August 2019,omaralkhinjmsb,It lacked many of the major events that we were wanting for
23 June 2019,andrewjaramillo,"I was so EXCITED to see this movie. After I saw it, I was like.... WhAT A PIECE OF GARBAGE!!! To me, this film and Infinity War felt like it was rushed of not see any extra scenes that we were so exited to see. This movie was ok, I mean like Time travel? Come on, I expected more from this director!"
21 August 2019,slotvin-716-489087,"The whole plot in this installment of Avengers hinges on a rat that just so happens to touch a button, in a van...

Also, time traveling always ruins a movie. If they can travel back to NYC to 2012, then it means that the plot we saw in this movie, already happened in the first Avengers movie in 2012... It's all too silly."
5 May 2019,pmitchelluk,"Nothing really happening ....Captain Marvel is in it for a bit...Black Panther was in it too, not sure why

4 May 2019,stephengeorgiouasto,"Poor cgi for big budget movie! Nothing special in acting, regular things... Copy story from other movies like Inception and Star Trek.. Poor cinematography and soundtrack! General nothing special, nothing unique!"
13 May 2019,driverinteractive_st,"Highlights of why it's terrible.

Infinity stones control the flow of the universe and cannot be removed (sorceress supreme - endgame), I destroyed the stones (Thanos - endgame).

Killing yourself while someone tries to stop you is not the other person making a sacrifice (soul stone would not be acquired)

A sword cannot cut vibranium, jesus thors hammer doesn't scratch the ain't (Thanos America)

Scarlet witch can easily kill Thanos so why doesn't she finish the job.

The power of the gauntlet is the user can harness the power of the stones without being affected by them. (iron man and hulk would be unharmed, Thanos was only injured because he was trying to destroy them, he explains this at the start)

An android linked to a cloud would know that she is and would switch off her WiFi.

Someone who would contaminate 50 years of history because he misses his girlfriend is a personality trait that would prevent them being able to wield thors hammer.

There are hundreds of inconsistencies compared to the established universe, if you are giving this film a ten star rating take off your rose tinted glasses."
17 August 2019,villard,"This latest of the Avengers series is pretty predictable because it is so formulaic: a convoluted set of story strings that must come together at the end, gratuitous little interpersonal dramas, and lots and lots of explosions, fistfights, and a pseudo battle of Armageddon. Also, predictably, the final battle must invoke Deus ex machina to save the day.

It's too bad that a lot of engaging actors and Marvel characters are wasted on such an insipid, uninspiring script.

The God wannbe, Thanos, is a boring and not a terribly scary sci-fi villain. He looks like a World Wrestling Federation refugee who overdosed on steroids. And, the quest for the five magic stones that give power over the entire universe sounds like a gimmick straight out of an adolescent-level video game.

The first 60 minute takes forever to ramp-up. And the viewer is lost without remembering the previous installment,""Infinity War."" After a padded full three hours of superhero antics - so many superheroes I can't keep them straight - the ending is dismally anticlimactic. Killing off Iron Man seems terribly misplaced. And, just to drag out the boredom, it follows up with a painfully long shot of all the super heroes - clad in black - at a funeral that is, well, deadly.

A forgettable fractured sci-fi yarn."
11 August 2019,adevillette-1,If you like spending three hours listening to explosions and ridiculous plot then this is the movie for you.

6 May 2019,imamarpaul-04191,"I have seen Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, Dark Knight, and all others imdb top movies or top 20 movies and they are one of the best movies. I was very excited to see the endgame and when I saw it, i was surprised to see how boring this movie is and it was waste of time. Infinity war was much much better than end game. This movie doesn't even deserve a rank in IMDB and still people are mad for this movie."
6 August 2019,ben-snooks,Firstly I'm a big film buff. I watch on average one film per day crossing genres and countries. I watched the first two hours then turned this movie off and went to bed. Seriously two hours to cover what should only take about 40 to 50 mins. Normally films have twenty minutes to set the story and introduce the characters. This film spends one hour reintroducing characters from the other movies then the characters decide what to do. Then another hour of idle chit chat. This movie is full of itself. I'm so glad I didn't bother going to the cinema to watch this. I'm sure there was going to be some action at some point but I ran out of patience.

31 May 2019,jeremycorbyn,"I didn't think this was politically correct enough. Captain Marvel is my favourite MCU character and It caused me great pain when the lovely Captain Marvel was brutally punched by the savage beast known as Thanos. I was overwhelmed with a great urge to help her like a heroic chivalrous knight but unfortunately as I sat there watching it on the screen in the cinema and knowing it wasn't exactly real, I knew I couldn't do anything about it and the second I realised that I burst into tears crying. If only I had the power to transport myself to fictional films I would've helped her out. I also thought the effects were terrible for a film with a $250 million plus budget and I felt Thor's alcoholism was inappropriate for a film that's watched by many children."
26 May 2019,jochuuuumd,"It was a long time ago that i saw a movie this bad. It was a mix of Grease, Dirty Dancing and Star Wars combined. The endless tear-pulling scenes with heavy music and long faces. Storylines bouncing from left to right. At one point all wizards, superheros and comic heros came out of nowere to help fight the bad guy. It made no sense whatsoever. You have to be under 11 to appriacte this story. Sesame Street is a philosophical and deep story in comparison to this bad excuse for a movie."

In fact, just don't waste your money on this piece of crap.

It's a politically correct movie (aka boring) where every minority has to be included, to make it politically correct, and where you have tons of mediocre superheroes that are so boring you can't even remember their names.

I hope this is the last Avengers movie, because it just makes no sense anymore. Since Marvel was taken by ""politically correct"" people, their movies have became uninteresting, unintelligent, and plain boring. Just like everything else they took over."

2 July 2019,Frankaub-1,"If you go see this movie, go see it in an IMAX 3D or something like that because 3 hours is too long for this movie.

The story is really bad I van understand that they don't want to repeat the same story in the comic book but the reason why Thanos choose to wipeout half the population is just stupid and what he do after that? Yeah he destroy the stone and retire. What a great villain...

So our super hero go take care of Thanos easily and then nothing for a very long period of time. For a Marvel movie their is not much action and for an intelligent, deep or funny movie that's not a bad thing but for a movie like this it's just boring. I guess they think that since their is a lot of action at the end that we will forget the middle.

They other thing that really bother's me is how important it seem to show how strong women are. The power of women yeah... Men are lazy, dumb and useless like thor in this movie and women are strong and save the day like Captain Marvel, Valkyrie, Gamora etc.

Marvel's writers must understand that Easter eggs, some action at the end of the film and showing the power of feminity do not make up for a bad script.

the only thing that I really like in this movie is that finally we saw some hero die."
13 May 2019,abdulbashur,"Terrible movie. I have never been a big fan, of Marvel and even less of MCU, but there were several good movies within that universe.... but this one as the Infinity Gauntlet, destroyed all.... No sense to talk about, the respect of the comic source.... but Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and many others involved on their comic origin of the characters has to be suffering in hell seeing how their creations were terribly undermined....... but just analizing from a cinematographic point of view, this film has a terrible argument, script, direction and very poor characters.... 2 hours of the film were not needed, and all the structure that were builded for this collapsed with this ending. Plot holes and nonsense everywhere.

This film represents what social media can do.... in a bad way. Stay away, if you can."
28 July 2019,hypercube001,"Watching Avengers Endgame started as a nice story that soon became boring and predictable. The problem is that it's supposed to end an era, to be a big moment before the curtain fall, but instead tries to pave the way for Marvell phase 4. There were some interesting moments, some funny moments that really made me smile, but at the end it all fell flat. Flat as a rug. They tried to cram each and everyone in the movie, but in my opinion it feels fake, like parading with fake cardboard masks. The CGI-fest soon became boring...except for the de-aging of Michael Douglas, that was 100% uncanny valley material. I was watching it feeling nothing, feeling dead inside. Then the woke trend rear its ugly head. Anyway, it's safe to say that I'll avoid Marvel in the future. The Endgame should stay the endgame. It's time to move on."

To what end. I guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could have spent on basically anything else and it would have been more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing I guess."

The time travel, plot holes and cheesy death scenes all were too confusing. These movies have consistently pandered to its audiences and this one was no different. If anything it was worse."
14 August 2019,maphy775,"OMG! What have I just watched? Remake of Avengers: Infinity War?

The last installment of Avengers looks like another Infinity War with table turning (this time we won) and introduction of few new elements such as Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and time machine. The rest is pretty much the same: whole lot of super-heroes doing crash-smash-flash-zap-bang super-fictional thing we already seen in earlier Avengers. OK, have to admit CGI is awesome but if you strip that the result is below average movie to watch once and leave in archive (if you mistakenly bought disc).

Bottom line, I really don't see End Game as a ""Masterpiece"" just because it filled-up box office emerging on top of all movies. It is not something we have not seen before, no breakthrough, not better than Infinity War. Just good advertising boosted this up on hall of fame scale."

18 August 2019,justinboy-50295,"It's hard to believe that this is the highest grossing movie of all time. It's not even that good of a Marvel movie.

I understand that this is based on a comic book characters but damn! The fact that this movie is so successful is pretty much the reason why Hollywood thinks they can get away making movies that aren't all that well thought out but look cool. The first hour was downright painful to get through and if they had taken out a lot of the unnecessary crap, this movie easily could have been 2 hours long."
15 August 2019,nickgoughnour,Man what a let down after Infinity War. Virtually no action in a superhero movie. Predictable plot with lame time warping around all over the place. And what in God's name did you do with Thor's character after the last movie holy crap! So glad I didn't waste my time in a theater for this one.
6 August 2019,wollmuschi,I wish I could say more about this but my title says it all. Nothing wrong with a good mainstream movie but I rather sit on my toilet for three hours than watch this crap.
9 August 2019,itsmehudson,Love most of the marvel movies so far (except captain marvel) but this was a total let down :(
3 August 2019,erick-67607,So i just watched it for the second time yesterday and i have to be honest this movie is boring as hell until the final fight and now that I watched it for the second time the final fight was ok this movie is so overated in my eyes firat time i watched it i was nearly falling asleep in theater because nothing intersting was happenning people going to hate me for this but I dont care I had more fun watching Dark Phonenix then this boring ass movie mcu movies are so overated in my opinion!
19 May 2019,sophiabrown-43038,"A lot of the movie was pretty good. the fight scene was awesome, especially when all the female characters got together. however the movie really romanticised tony, which didn't make any sense as it was made clear that he didn't care about anyone but himself, and was unwilling to help save HALF of the universe in case it interferes with his life. in my opinion, seeing someone like nebula defeat thanos would have been better (and fitted her arc of wanting revenge on thanos for ripping her apart). overall, this romanticisation of a character who has spent every mcu movie, especially this one, only caring for himself and refusing to accept consequences for his actions become the hero was disappointing and ruined the film for me."
19 August 2019,alpelletier88-940-765957,Way to long of a movie probably could of cut an hour out of it and it wouldn't have made a difference. Probably one of the worst Avenger movies I've seen. Very slow to get to the point and it do not hold my interest or my husband's.
31 July 2019,hamedtgh,"I think it was one of the worst superhero movies. In this film, they destroyed all the preparations made in the previous episode. It was very good to use the idea of time travel and it could be much better. The story of getting the stones was written without much thought. All stones were very comfortable. Changes that were ignored in time. Captain Marvel's role was very empty. The character's presence in the film was really wrong."
3 August 2019,sergey-zotchev,"I managed to watch 40 minutes of this crap, and then could not stand it any longer. You must be a true fan of Marvel Universe to see it until the end. If you are not, avoid - nothing makes sense in this utterly boring movie. Acting is really bad too. High-end special effects cannot save it."
17 May 2019,officialjoeyperkins,"I did not care for a single second of what was really happening. Too much emphasis on certain characters while others are left in just to make it seem more ""epic"". Hulk was the only character of any entertainment value. I was more entertained by the audiences reaction to certain scenes than the actual film. The scene where Black Widow dies, the girl behind me whispered to her friend: ""Is she dead?"" Like no s*** you just saw her fall of a cliff and slam on the ground.

Besides the 30 minute battle, how they handled Tony Stark's death was well done, especially the funeral. If they ended on that long shot showing all the characters, then I would of liked it a little more, but it just kept going.

It bored me to death. I only saw it because on how it was considered a ""cinematic event"" to most. To the lovers of film, I really don't recommend it. Just wait for the final battle to be put up on YouTube or something and watch that."
21 August 2019,Masoud_Ferasati,"I don't know what to say. Was it a movie or some kind of joke? Terrible screenplay and ridiculous performances by some ridiculous actors (of course they are not actors).

I would probably likeit if I were a sheep!!!"
20 August 2019,Freedom060286,"There was nothing unexpected in this one. Of course the characters that were dead somehow came back to life. We all knew that had to happen before we watched it.

Obviously this kind of movie is made for children and for adults with the minds of children. But I can't imagine any normal adult enjoying it."
12 August 2019,fivos-64546,The worst of all the avengers sequence. Boring apart from some cool action scenes. Stupid scene when CA lifts thor's hammer wtf. Also we were expecting Dr Strange to show his real powers and see him more in the movie as he is the most powerful
1 July 2019,jordan-mccoy827,"I dont see why people think its that great. We already know whats gonna happen. They just copy it from the comics. You want a good superhero movie. Make the movie first, then the comic book. It will save time and money."
28 June 2019,SusieQCP,"I expected so much from this film but just feel so disappointed by it. A poor and incoherent story with so many contradictions within it plus a total waste of my favourite character - amongst others (like Thanos himself). I did go and rewatch it in the cinema a second time and realised that, without all the excitement and expectation I went in with the first time I was just really really bored.

It did have some nice ""moments"", especially the anticipated big fight towards the end. Some characters get a good inning - love Antman and, of course, Iron Man but this is my least favourite MCU film.

And the ending...........sigh!"
7 August 2019,tymon_tm,"...and if I lasted more than an hour, I'd probably come up with more adjectives

this is THE worst superhero movie in a line of really bad films. all the 'old' cast (who reeeaally got older throughout the marvel cineverse) looks like they've just came to get their final paycheck. it just feels forced, like a bad commercial, or like a prog rock song that should've ended few minutes ago. none of what we see makes any sense, there's no sensible plot , even ""fun stuff"" comes off as rather sad. and that's the word that describes the final (?) avengers movie the best way - sad..."
28 July 2019,alex-zhukovets,"There are endles topics, the sci-fi universe could be so immensely diverse, but only the pure greed and the striving for money making lets us 1v1 with THIS.

Why dont we take the top Nebula/Hugo winning scenarios? Because we obviously perceive our viewer through the prism of arrogance and dont evend dare to waste corporate budgets on something worthy.

Such a waste of time, ressources and such a stamp on Marvel.

Bad, just bad."
22 August 2019,dussaultjulien,"This is the worst superhero movie that I've ever seen since Avengers Infinity Wars, Captain Marvel and the reboot of Fantastic Four. All of those movies are masterpieces compared to this heaping pile of trash.

The only good thing that has come out of this movie is the memes. The pacing is agonizingly slow, the story honestly doesn't make much sense at all, the characters that we all once knew and loved have now become boring, robotic sleeves to Disney ,they are just there for a paycheck at this point, and boy did they get a huge one for some lackluster, boring and honestly some of the worst performances I've seen on screen in my 24 years.

Get ready to see Robert Downey jr. Acts like he is in a high school play with his children, the only genuine father figure that actually seems real is Jeremy Renner in this film, otherwise it is ridiculously boring, full of potholes, and it's just a giant flashback and re-use of old footage that honestly gave them material that they should have used differently.

If you're looking to be in pain, by all means go and see this movie in the theater, but if you'd like to skip the boring Parts like I did rent it on DVD. It's not worth buying"
2 August 2019,deef-deef,"Okay so much wrong with this movie. I can only give it 3 stars.

Why is Thanos so strong even without the stones? So many hero's get stupidly underplayed in this movie (Spiderman, Captain Marvel etc).

Meh I had high hopes, but instead we got a huge mess of a movie."
2 August 2019,genderarm,"There's absolutely no pay off to be had plot wise here. Nothing to see here people. Fast forward through to the last hour and you're good. You will have missed nothing.

This movie was either way too long or just nowhere near long enough. This was supposed to be a part II of conclusion that wraps up an entire universe of characters spanning 20 movies and they couldn't be arsed to give us a third act?

Unfortunately, they titled the movie Avengers: Endgame, and making a sequel to that would be nearly as bad as having a movie titled Rambo: First Blood Part II. What would they have called a third movie? Avengers: The Really Real End Time, Place, Realm. (No, we honestly mean it this time.)

Sadly, the first hour or so of the movie is Ant Man trying to save a tacked on, marketing driven first act that pays off in no way. Meanwhile, also tied to marketing, some major plot holes and omissions were completely egregious.

A large portion of the principle photography for this movie was done alongside side Infinity Wars itself, which would've made sense if they'd had a coherent story line by then.

Leave it to the screenwriters, they'll make something of it. Leave it to the editors, they'll fix it in post. Well, somebody forgot to fix it. And it wasn't me. Fortunately, marketing fixes everything.

Let's face it, there are two kinds of people in this world: those who for a final movie who are just going to love it no matter what, those who view the movie with the same critical eye they would the others, and those who decide that there can only be two types of people.

Why are there always two kinds of people? Look at Loki! Now that's an interesting character. He can be good; he can be bad. He's fiendish and lovable. He's a hero and a villain and an anti-hero and-still, somehow-human, god, and ice thing.

Honestly, Infinity Wars couldn't have come at a worse time. It was originally a much larger unification of Marvel heroes and villains, and now that Disney owns all of the other Marvel Universe crap, that movie could've been the Infinity Wars, with a plot that started to wrap up before the last movie.

Ah well, maybe in 20 years they'll redo the whole thing again with the X-Men and Silver Surfer in it (take or leave the Fan-4. This is super likely.

I heard Spider Man: Far From Home was really really good, but I have no desire to see it. Why? Because it sounds to me like Spider Man visits France for Holiday and Meets some Good Guys and some Bad Guys and forces you to watch the credits so you can see 30 seconds that tease you into watching the next movie that's just going to do the same thing."
2 May 2019,jones_p,"I haven't nt seen all the Marvel movies, but I've seen some - the Iron mans, the Ant mans, Cpt Marvel. I enjoyed them. I thought I'd go and see what the fuss was about. However this, is so formulaic, ridicilous and boring I couldn't take it for the whole film. I walked out after 2 hours, and it felt every bit as long as that. If you're not a huge Marvel fan already, you may well not like this film, because I feel it's somewhat self-indulgent. It's like an effort to squeeze a bit more money out of fans."

5 August 2019,tehlers,"Some parts were done well, revisiting the previous films was a treat but the film overall was pretty lousy. Cap and Tony's departure were not well executed. There are several reviews already on why Cap's exit was out of character and unlikely, look them up if you don't see it. Tony, always wrong, sacrifices himself finally after a lifetime of selfishness, which is a heroic exit in a way, but was a pretty lame ending for such an important character. The movie relies HEAVILY on trying to pull viewer's heartstrings vice have decent writing and make sense in many ways. The SJW nonsense has been out of control in these movies as well for sometime now, more prevalent in the agents of shield series though tbh. Time for Disney to let it go."
30 June 2019,hbuddy-77014,"You can't even consider this a film. It's a 3 hour tv episode. Films should work on their own. Even batman returns and the dark knight understood this, and work on their own. This ""film"" is okay enough. The ""original"" score is terrible. The acting is decent. The CGI is way overused, not a single shot without some CG ""enhancements"". The story is, well, near nonexistent once you take out the action sequences. I'd give this a 5/10. Only rated it 1 star because a franchise film does not deserve a spot in the top 100."

Direction and editing just feels amateurish. I couldnt deal with anymore after the 1st hour it was excruciating. It feels like they gave a class of children the old ""how would you end the avengers"" lesson and just put all the answers in a bag and picked one.... and then just made it work.... or so they thought. I may feels the urge to watch the 1st half again and hope it inspires me to watch the conclusion but its highly doubtful."

Where is the continuity in these films? Luckily this is the last we will ever see of this franchise! Until someone decides to do a remake as there are no original ideas anymore. J.J.Abrams you now have more films to ruin 👍🏻"

Thick Thor, Professor Hulk brilliant the rest average."
1 August 2019,mitke013,"Watch this movie, it can be far worse! I understand that Infinity War set a high bar but this one is a joke; time travel, better known as ""deus ex machina"" for lazy writing, is primary thing here that was never explained.

And trust me, that is the least of the problems!

Yes, the effects were nice so hence 2/10 but effects were never so important in Avengers; others at least had some sort of story and action, this one is dull."
20 May 2019,moudekerk-82980,"Acting extremely sub-par, terrible story, and a cheap piece of non directional fan service."
4 May 2019,Paynebyname,"I've just come from watching Endgame and I must say that I am disappointed.

I loved Civil War and I loved Infinity War. When I came out of those films, I knew immediately that they were great and that I wanted to see them again. With Endgame, I'm not sure.

I respect how they were prepared to show the consequences of what Thanos had done but by killing him off so quickly and then them having to do their own stone quest (hadn't we already seen Thanos doing this in IW) it felt slow and lazy. Worse still was that it felt very self-indulgent and attempting to be clever for clever sake.

Like how Back to the Future II considered itself clever for showing the events of the first film but with Marty flitting around behind the scenes to ensure that it all still happened. I know it's meant to be fan pleasing but it really felt like a gimmick and lacking in confidence. Almost like it was saying 'Hey guys, this will make you smile'. If you want to make me smile, concentrate on maintaining the quality of your product rather than directly trying to make me like you.

But the trouble with messing around with timelines and bouncing around is that it makes the audience start asking questions during the film. The linearity that we'd seen in IW and the imminent fast approaching threat is replaced in Endgame with a lack of direction and characters that are earlier versions of who the audience have seen.

In IW we were shown Thanos. He was written to be sympathetic or at least a character that we the audience could understand. He believed in what he was doing and this made him more rounded. But in Endgame, that version is dispatched quickly and we are supplied with a 2014 (?) Thanos who isn't the character we know but is just a token bad guy.

This Thanos hasn't made the sacrifice at Vormire, he isn't the guy that would empathise with Scarlet Witch for what she did to Vision. He has suddenly become a token cut out evil bad guy that needs to be defeated. Hell, the writers even manage to forget their own time loop by saying that this Thanos has learnt that he doesn't want to wipe out 50% anymore because they are too ungrateful. How does he know this when the 2014 Thanos has only just literally arrived in the post wipeout Universe? How has he had time to form the opinion that his previous quest for a 50% cull isn't worthy?

Is this a case of the writers being terrified that they had created a bad guy that people related to or was it a fear that they'd written themselves into a hole? Why go to the effort of creating that character in IW to suddenly kill him off at the beginning of Endgame just for a dramatic punch?

For me, the time travelling and stone gathering wasted time to create unimportant scenes that fundamentally undermine the films that came before. In my opinion it would have been better if they had shown the remaining Avengers preparing to do some Avenging and maintained the single minded linearity of IW of battling towards and reaching a post click Thanos and somehow reversing his work.

The more I think of the film, the more plot holes and frustrations manifest themselves. Thor's drinking and man child antics might have been initially funny but one begins to realise that they are deliberately doing this to clip his wings. Likewise with Hulk, his primordial desire to smash and destroy has been removed to think it out and he has become an embarrassing shadow of his former self.

The thing that is meant to be amazing about the MCU is the world building but inconsistencies have been appearing and there are so many in Endgame that it makes you question whether these two films are written by the same people.

In IW, Thanos is a dangerous and credible threat because he has the infinity stones. He takes on half of the Avengers, Strange and some of the Guardians on Titan and smashes them and then takes on the other half on Wakanda and smashes them. Yet it is Stormbreaker (whose creation we have seen been hard earned by a motivated Thor) that has the power to take down Thanos even when he has a full complement of Infinity Stones.

Yet we roll forward to Endgame and we have literally all the good guys together in one place, Cap with his shield, Tony fully powered up, Scarlet Witch p*ssed and vengeful, Capt Marvel who can seemingly do anything and Thor wielding both Mjolnir AND Stormbreaker and Thanos NOT in possession of the gauntlet, yet they can't defeat him.

It's like the fights in IW were so amazing because the good guys were taking on an unbeatable foe yet here he is now seemingly defeatable by the 'rules' that the writers established . A good example of this would be in IW when Cap is the last man standing before Scarlet Witch and he grabs the gauntlet. You see the look of admiration/respect on Thanos' face that Cap is holding open the gauntlet before he punches him to the ground yet now that scene seems pointless.

The writers for Endgame seem to have been driven to undo everything they did in IW. All the tension, all the sacrifice, all the development of Thanos discarded for well, I don't know what. It makes no sense.

IW had two incredible scenes that used to choke me up. When Cap appears in the train station, the Avengers theme kicks in and Falcon and Widow take down the henchman in a wonderfully choreographed scene. In just that one scene it shows them coming to the rescue, it shows how intuitively they work together and it showcases their heroism.

Likewise when Thor creates Stormbreaker and makes his entrance on Wakanda, I felt it for the journey that Thor has been on. He's had to contend with loss and defeat and humiliation and this is his redemption. Here is a character that has earned his game changing weapon and when he arrives and demands to face a character that everyone else is running away from, I want to punch the air.

But in Endgame, that feels like it has to be corrupted. We can't have Thor being dominant, let's break him and make him a fool. We can't have Thanos being complicated and relatable, let's make him a cut out bad guy. We can't have Hulk being rage fuelled and smashing stuff up, let's make him more sensitive and talking stuff out. We can't have Cap being stoic and heroic, let's have him ridiculing one of his own iconic lines in a silly gimmicky fight with himself and commenting on his butt. We can't have a powerful female character that we're invested in look sexy AND be able to take down Thanos, let's give Scarlet Witch a small part but focus our attention on a female character that hasn't earnt our admiration or desire for revenge.

To be honest, the 'rules of engagement' had been set so well in IW that when in Endgame Thanos massed his ranks against the Avengers and then ALL of the good guys showed up, I was almost expecting the camera to pull away and not show the fight given that it was so obviously going to be an easy win for the good guys.

And as for the big fight scene, it did reek of what DC always manage to do which is just throw everything into an end battle and bludgeon you with CGI and pyrotechnics so that you aren't really sure what is going on.

In the many fights in IW, you knew what was going on, you recognised the combatants, you understood the stakes and you identified the geography of the scene. In Endgame we got one big massive fight where everything was thrown in the pot and it was just assumed by the directors that we would be happy with all the flashing lights. And I have to say that considering that Steve and Tony fell out so hard, and that Tony's criticism of Steve was so unfair, that I really had hoped for more than just a handshake, a muttering of 'no worries' and 'here's your shield'. These guys wrote and directed Civil War, they created the line 'we fell out hard' and hence I had hoped for something deeper and more touching than a handshake.

Steve wrote Tony a letter telling him that when he needed him he'd be there but once again the Iron Man bias had to creep in and once again Tony was the victim and the ultimate hero.

But I think my biggest problem is how the convenient time travelling undermines everything. When a franchise starts retrofitting stuff (like Fury's eye being from a space cat), it's then hard to consider the previous stories.

Having 2014 Gamorra means that all the evolution that we saw her go through in GOTG 1 and 2 is wasted. Having Cap marry Peggy means the pain of his sacrifice, him seeing her in Winter Soldier when she is suffering from Alzheimer's, hell even his blossoming relationship with Sharon Carter is kinda irrelevant. Having seen Thor at last step away from his two weaker origin films into the entertainment of Ragnarok and the redemption in IW leaves us now with a bumbling buffoon.

We know that what makes Captain America what he is, is the serum that makes him a super soldier. That he was transformed from a weakling to a superhuman. Sam Wilson is not a super soldier and he didn't take the serum. He is Falcon. Now maybe in the comics he becomes Cap but Bucky is a super soldier. Is the new Cap going to foil an evil plot and be defeated with a tazer or a knife to the chest? Consider the beatings that Steve has taken and the physical strength that he has shown we can recognise that Sam Wilson does not have that.

I'm sorry to say but the Russo's have dropped the ball. Themselves and their writers have succumbed to their success and their desire to be engineers of political correctness and social change. I thought Endgame would be the high soaring end to this 10 year run of impressive movie entertainment but in the end the writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product for a chance to 'educate' us all. A real shame and a wasted opportunity.

Infinity War is clearly the highlight of the last 10 years but even now I fear that repeated viewings will render it pointless considering how the makers decided to fundamentally damage it."
18 August 2019,Maleplatypus,"Mild spoilers ahead: This movie could lose some 60 minutes and nobody would notice (or probably will - it would be more fun). Some great acting wasted.

And yet here we are, selling confusion to adolescents, regardless their age. Tell me if that slap Gamora (female) gives to StarLord (male) would be nearly acceptable if it has been the other way around? Layers of unethical messages and contradictions that go straight to the midbrain. Unfortunate script for many good actors that participated in this super production designed for super degeneration."
8 June 2019,dagallop,"What a crying shame that a movie that had so many people awaiting its arrival delivered so little. And, it seemed to take forever to deliver that!

I believe that this is one of the most critical reviews I have ever given and believe me, I firmly believe that it is wholly because my expectations were set so high by the franchise that it was pretty much doomed unless it was mind blowingly good.

If the story had had one thread of; 'that was believable' or even an odd; 'that could work' it may have been able to recover but, it doesn't. It doesn't even have a; 'that was cool' at any point either!

It's actually so boring I had finally found a movie I could replenish concessions during and didn't feel like I had missed anything. The reality is that I probably missed some really critical parts but it didn't matter, the movie had lost me long since then.

The entire story was so convoluted that it was just plain terrible. The basic thread was non existent and I agree with many other reviewers that certain characters were pointless.

Synopsis: Infinity wars was mediocre, this isn't. Also, personally, it has done so much harm to the franchise, I for one won't be bothering to spend the 'sizeable' costs involved in cinema excursions for any Avenger related future offering again."

This review would be disliked but I have to say this, this was the worst marvel movie after iron Man 2 for me. Some movies have loopholes in their script but this movie has some script in the loopholes. I guess this movie is getting such high reviews(near fight club and Lord of the rings) as people are emotional about the characters and they would think with their heart and not their brain. But if you actually think about the movie, that is , take your brain with you to the theatre, you would start observing the huge loopholes. And I do want to clear it out that I am not a person who is very picky about the story. I accept some flaws in a movie. But in this movie there are so many flaws that it becomes hardly acceptable. It was so bad that it killed all my interest in future superhero movies."
1 August 2019,jessybessy-at,"So I just waisted 5 precious minutes of my life. This superwoman character is absolutely not credible! Come on, she is not destructible, she has no limits, she can go light years in space and bring on her shoulders a whole spaceship back to earth...no, why make a whole movie, and involve and kill a bunch of other way cooler and believable characters on the way, when you can just use this, the one and only, incredible all-can-do woman and just finish the film in 5 minutes. It makes no sense what you people did there. Even Superman had his limits, and was vulnerable and felt real, we were glad to accept him as a hero, because he felt like one of us. But she, she is nothing like us, humans, so I just don't get it. Sorry, one star for this nonsensical thing you call Avengers: Endgame. And yes, my rating is based on 5 minutes watching, but it is like reading a book - if you don't like the first pages, you won't fall for the rest of it..."
31 July 2019,woah-24491,"The only good thing about this movie is the nostalgia of old marvel movies,the time travel logic is stupid and its extremely boring just 2 hours of people morning then 45 minutes of cgi,its a disgrace to movies for this movie to be this high"
30 July 2019,abtgeorgia,"It was normal movie but captain marvel ruined it. She was, very overpowered and she was strongest character. Adding her in this movie was very big mistake plot was coll tho but it wqs ruined by capitan marvel"
5 August 2019,romanelpidio,Soooooo bouring !! called action movie ??? seriously ! it is actually a sleeping pills !
10 July 2019,Navitza,"Quantity over quality. The whole Avengers series is based on this principle and therefore, the finale rating that this series deserves is 1."
20 May 2019,sophiabrown-43038,"Did i watch the same movie as everyone else? why are so many people leaving such high ratings for this movie? i guess it being the end of it factors in, but it just wasn't a good film. some good parts, but they take up like 3% of the film."
12 August 2019,me-08123,"3hrs of zooming around jumping through time, with stops for flat emotional diatribes . Then an end battle where the actors who are retiring were given a story exit. Blah blah. At least 'infinity war' had more laughs and a few nerdgasm scenes like Thor arriving in wakanda. End game looks and feels like a money extraction excercise . Perhaps they should have made this into a trilogy with part one thanos winning (2hrs), part 2 all about the emotional distress and how messed up things are (2hrs), then part 3 how they sort stuff out (2hrs). A bit like the first star wars trilogy . Overall meh"
16 August 2019,FahimShahriar45,"I really liked Infinity war,but endgame is so much boring. Thor and Hulk were totally wasted.Average CGI and actions.Some dialogues felt forced and totally unnecessary.I expected more from marvel. The Infinity war ending was much better and epic.I will take endgame as an alternate ending"
30 July 2019,airfieldinvestigations,"About as bad as it gets - even worse than Captain Marvel and I thought that was bad

save your money give this a mess a miss"
3 August 2019,usamasight,If you are a 7 years old kid or you have a 7 years old mind you will love this movie ...
2 August 2019,gevans209,Seriously I am actually convinced now that nobody in the industry knows how to write an ending. they are so focused on leaving plot opening for a possible future opportunity that they cant give a satisfying ending! Game of thrones and the decline of Stranger things to mention a few.
20 May 2019,viktor-12087,Didn't like this marvel movie and I didn't like the others
29 June 2019,dausdaus,Just some super heroes whining the whole movie. Such an example!
3 August 2019,mahdikey,Full of mistakes and Weaknesses this movie violated Previous marvel movies.
20 June 2019,bdmunck,"I have watched the movie when it was just released. A couple of months later and I was looking at the reviews. I cannot believe all the 10/10 scores for this movie.

Personally I was extremely disappointed with this final movie. Infinity war was an amazing good movie, end game delivers a very simple story based on the time machine concept with plenty of flaws. While I understand the hype and the popularity of the MCU the movie was not bringing me what I was hoping for. There is no further clarification of what led to this movie. The new hulk is another example what I believe was too far fetched. But I don't think I should continue. Surely it is a must see, but for me remains Endgame one of the less convincing movie of this long series of movies brought to us in the las ten years."
17 August 2019,luukasleohietanen,So boring and predictable story with cringe moments such a dissapointment
8 July 2019,nptscherlund,There's There will be blood and more recently Leave No Trace. And then there's this crap. Acting that makes my eyes hurt and a story so bad I just want to stop watching (which I did). It's movies like this that makes me lose faith in the art of film making. And the rating 8.7 just makes me wanna stop talking to people. What a waste of money...
11 August 2019,Ratisbonanza,"...only to - after almost 2.5 hours of boring preparation - end up in a happy ending and of course more CGI laden version of ""Avengers: Infinity war"" with all the protagonists ever to have been in Marvel movies appearing on screen in a CGI festival which shows the true dilemma of modern movie making and the the Marvel world in special. They wanna pack it all in and in the end they get nothing, mixing it all up in a terrible way. We suddenly have Captain America to hold Mjölnir, Pepper Potts got a suit and fights (aargh!),Scarlet Witch seems to be the most dangerous opponent to Thanos, Thanos being apparently stronger without the stones (so don't go for them, dumb ass!) and among that all we have valkyrie riding her winged horse, just to mention a few. The only good scenes are the ones with Thor, and they are also the only ones where the emotional side is delivered in a believable way. Which is also a hint where the true magic of such movies _could_ be: telling stories of myths and magic, and not CGI overkill movies. Sadly, that's what we got once more, and the typical US approach anyway. So, this movie is nothing but 2.5 hours of time waste to end up in roughly 20 minutes of senseless CGI pseudo battle. If you watch it to be able to judge for yourself and get another idea of contemporary movie making, you can do that while making the dishes or doing something else useful in parallel."
10 August 2019,rmills411,"It was a fairly entertaining film for the first couple of hours (probably worth a 6 or 7), with a few exceptions, - not least the abomination of making Thor a fat drunken slob. Then it slowly became apparent that this was all about shedding the old traditional heroes (as originally written) and replacing them with politically correct versions as per the recent trend. I'm sure it will appeal to enough millennials to make tons of money, but I suspect that this is where I get off. If the PC brigade want ethnic minority and female heroes, - why not create new ones instead of corrupting the original stories. Until they add a White (or Black) Widower, male Captain Marvel (as per the original stories) or a white panther, etc., for balance. Which, I'm guessing, is no time soon."
29 July 2019,lazejordanov,Wost movie ever seen total waste of time no action no nothing just bad bad bad bad
29 July 2019,onlinevirtual,"What's this dribble, there's about 30 minutes of action and it's a predictable boring at that and overall mind numbing silly movie , all but this one are okay , what agenda are the feminists pushing as they try going woke and ending up broke. Shame ,hope you downloaded it and were not shammed out of any money to watch..."
25 July 2019,viqarakram,What have all these peeps seen in this movie i was soooo bored i fell asleep its a waste of3 hours of my life...pls dont waste ur 3 hrs on this
23 July 2019,BigKlevice,"This film is so garbage I can't even comprehend it, none of the ""emotional""scenes don't even make a tear shed at all, Tony Stark's death was terribly written and acted out, Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is horrid. The action scenes are slow and drawn out, and the ending scene is completely disappointing. This is a very inadequate superhero film compared to others such as The Incredible Hulk (2003) and Steel (1997). To sum it up a terrible example of Marvel's avengers."
18 May 2019,miller420,Really? Peggy had a family. And what about Bucky??
1 August 2019,Exorcistus,"My 10 year old nephew LOVES super heroes and he's watched all Marvel and DC movies, but after 30+ minutes into this one he says: ""This movie is no good. We are wasting our time"".

I couldn't agree more. We forced ourselves to continue watching though, maybe it would get better. It didn't. At times we both laughed at how bad it was.

The 10 year old who (again) LOVES super hero movies suddenly stopped watching while there was still 40 minutes left, he just went out to play instead. At this point I couldn't care less of how things turned out at the end so I just turned it off prematurely.

Just an indication of how failed this movie was, in our opinion."
12 May 2019,weemalky,"How did they get this so wrong?

Absolute travesty, and possibly the most disappointed I've ever been with a movie.

Lately disappointment is a recurring theme, with a string of average or outright terrible ""blockbusters""."
25 August 2019,skov-62663,I really liked Infinity war and really wanted to see the next movie. To my surprise it was pathetic. Thanks God I wathed it on Blu Ray and many scenes I simply skipped.
4 June 2019,adjero,Listen I'll take X-Men over the avengers any day. boring characters
10 May 2019,annieplease,"I'm a huge fan of the MCU, and honestly, I think I've watched Infinity War over 20 times prior to watching Endgame. I had high expectations for the sequel, and actually thought it would be deeper than it turned out to be. Endgame is intricate, yes. But intricately shallow. Here are some things I thought would happen but didn't. First of all, I counted on every line in Infinity War, thinking it would imply something greater in Endgame.

Example 1: When Thanos asked Red Skull ""Where is the Soul Stone?"", Red Skull responded, ""You should know, it extracts a terrible price."" Thanos replied with ""I am prepared,"" and Red Skull said, ""We all think that at first. We are all wrong.""

This led me to think that perhaps in Endgame, Thanos regrets his decision to kill Gamora, and somehow the stone would turn on him or doesn't work the way it should because what he did to her was not really love. He selfishly sacrificed her, and true love is putting someone else's needs before your own. Although this part is sort of redeemed in Endgame when Nat sacrificed herself for Clint (to contrast what Thanos did to Gamora), Endgame still should have shown how Thanos was ""wrong"" in thinking that he could let Gamora go if he did truly love her. Doing so would have also added another facet his character. However, in Endgame, Thanos was not the same as he was in Infinity War. He had no conviction and became even more ruthless in his avenging.

Example 2: Dr. Strange told Tony Stark ""We're in the endgame now"" and ""there was no other way"" right before he turned to dust.

I had high hopes for Dr. Strange and his creative problem-solving skills in Endgame. I thought he had perhaps sent the time stone to the past or future to do some ""work"" prior to handing it over to Thanos. But nope, there was nothing. He handed over the actual stone. There was no manipulation of it. There was also no game plan. Dr. Strange HAD NO PLAN! He basically saw his 14+ million possible outcomes that they would win by some stroke of luck, and bet everything on that one chance (which was a mouse hitting some switches in Ant-Man's time machine van). Wouldn't it have been more intricate if he had sent the stone to the past or future to tamper with time, or to somehow orchestrate events in a way where their winning was more premeditated and planned, than merely by some stroke of luck or some random chance?

Example 3 In Infinity War, when Vision offered to die to save half the universe, Captain American told him, ""We don't trade lives Vision"", and Vision said, ""Captain, 70 years ago you laid down your life to save how many millions of people, tell me why is this any different.""

I thought Captain America would be the one who would sacrifice himself in Endgame, perhaps the one to undo the snap. He was the one who previously laid down his life for millions and perhaps he should have done it in Endgame.

I'm bummed about a few other things. I couldn't relate to the characters as much as I did in Infinity War. Endgame's characters' interactions felt more scripted and robotic.

I wasn't convinced that Morgan was Pepper's daughter. I didn't sense that connection between them. There was no scene of Pepper tending to Morgan in the movie, except for the end when she held Morgan at Tony's funeral. I didn't feel sad at Tony's funeral. Nobody cried there. Yes, he was a true hero, but there should have been some tears. Maybe they all saw that his death was unpreventable, but still, the loss didn't seem emotionally impactful (to me).

I really did not like what they did to Thor in Endgame. They stripped him of his dignity. I thought maybe they would redeem him by the movie's end, but they didn't. He was still fat and no longer desired to lead Asgard. Back on the alcoholism road, maybe? Thor also had both Mjolnir and Stormbreaker in Endgame, yet he couldn't even strike Thanos (who had no stones to empower him this time).

The melding of Banner and Hulk was underwhelming. It was Hulk's extremity that made him The Hulk. Banner-Hulk may seem like ""the best of both worlds,"" but it made the character too palatable, too compromised, and not exciting or powerful. He wasn't a strong fighter like the Hulk, and he just looked like a green Thanos with glasses. There should have been a Hulk and Thanos rematch to redeem the Hulk at least!

Also, how did Captain Marvel come in just the right time at the beginning and the end to help save the day? That end-credit scene in Captain Marvel where she comes back asking ""Where's Fury?"" should have been included in this movie. I also think she should have been included MORE in this movie if she is to be considered an Avenger and a part of the team.

And the ending...how did Captain America age after living a ""normal"" life with Peggy? And even if they did marry, wouldn't he still have looked only 40 years old after she had grown old and died? And what if they had kids? Wouldn't their kids run into Peggy's original kids with her previous husband? Confusing and just odd.

There were a LOT of superheroes in this movie (especially when the snap was reversed), but they all felt like strangers to me. I could not connect with them, perhaps because there was only so much that could be jam packed in 3 hours.

All in all, I thought the movie was good because it was still complex. I loved the action scenes and I enjoyed seeing some characters rekindling with loved ones from their past. However, this movie did fall short in quite a few areas and just wasn't as deep as I had hoped it would be. The time traveling had its own plot holes, and I truly miss Vision and the 2018 Gamora.

I think Infinity War was the better movie. Endgame, by itself, was a good standalone movie, but it wasn't well executed as Infinity War's sequel. Even though Infinity War and Endgame had the same sets of writers and directors, it didn't feel that way. The pacing, plot progression, and division of screen time for actors were handled more aptly in Infinity War, in my opinion."
4 August 2019,kalibr-56231,"What a boring, predictable excuse for a movie. I'm so glad I resisted the hype and didn't suffer through this in the theaters. It's obvious this movies reviews are artificially inflated on this site, just look at all the other negative reviews."
18 May 2019,demenenes,It is getting very boring now. not realistic at all
16 August 2019,Sammie75,I loved all the other movies..but I'm not sure I can even finish watching this...3hours of not getting to the damn point already...
9 August 2019,oliverstrange,"As a huge fan of marvel I can say that the characters I know and love that I expected to see in the grand finalé of a 22-movie saga, where nowhere to be found. Fat Thor was played off for jokes too much. Captain America was more Thor than actual Thor. Professor hulk was just a boring character. Thanos was nothing like how he was in the infinitely superior ""Infinity War"". Time travel rules was just cheap writing. An easy way out of a complex predicament crafted by two people with minimal creative abilities. The plot was littered with holes and just boring. This movie was not exciting. One of my biggest problems was the stupid one-liners and cheap jokes. This movie was not meant to be funny. There is room for humor, but there also needs to be room for plot and suspense and seriousness. Another of my biggest problems was cap lifting mjolnir. I have no problem with him lifting it. But it was anti-climactic. Good idea, but butchered in execution. I don't say this lightly or out of arrogance or vanity, but I, as a 15 year old kid could have created a better movie. Also, the greatest part of the film: Joe Russo got cast as the gay extra in his own movie."
19 May 2019,philip-09175,"What a waste of time. I am so sorry for all the Thor & Hulk fans. I really am. Movie makers played everyone for fools with all the hype. Lord of the Rings and Avatar remains my all time favorite. My advice to all those who havent watched the movie yet, please do yourself a favor and wait for the DVD. It is highly likely that you will feel wasted like me, so at least you will have saved the money."
12 May 2019,vamsi-2390,Not sure about the rave reviews. But was a huge let down. It felt as if they just wanted to end the series . Infinity war could have been a better ending. Lot of flaws on time travel theory as well.
20 May 2019,rukieain,"Time machine was the worst idea ever. I couldn't even understand every inch of the stories, it make no sense to me."
4 August 2019,dritonp,"Quite possibly the worst Avengers film in the series. Plot holes in every single scene, bland and cold acting. Sad really!"
23 July 2019,anthallberg,I haven't watched the movie. It just doesn't deserve 8.7
19 August 2019,woah-24491,"This movie dosent deserve to be this high on IMDb,it was bring and by far the worst avengers movie with a disapointing and predictable outcome,it ruined thanos and the heroes one with no casualties like every superhero movie,endgame was by far the worst most overrated marvel movie"
30 July 2019,dussaultjulien,"I hate how people are saying that this movie is epic, and that all the movies that preceded it were epic as well. There have only been a handful of Marvel movies that have actually been good, and this is not one of them.

Marvel, like The Simpsons, has run out of ideas and is now running off of a therom. If it has the word marvel in it, then it will sell. The story does not matter only the name, and it's finally starting to show, as it has for The Simpsons for years now. And the announcement of new movies is now no longer exciting for me.

Marvel honestly needs to take a step back and take their time in producing movies, as well as shows now too, like some of their most fantastic movies and shows, like the original Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, and even the Netflix Daredevil, which was surprisingly good and did a great job portraying the character. What the executives at Marvel don't seem to understand is that they in fact are not Epic, they're just putting trash out and unfortunately the masses are gobbling it up. Things become like goats, they'll eat anything that you put in front of them.

End game is one of the most unimpressive movies I've seen in a very long time. I cannot believe that I wasted almost four hours of my life watching this horrible, sad excuse for a superhero movie, if you could even call it that. The only great thing about the past few Marvel movies is the memes that have come out of it. The Russo Brothers Legacy will be the memes that were made from their movies, not the story itself nor the movies. Just because you have the lucasfilm lighting, as well as the CGI company behind you does not make you amazing. What makes anything amazing, story-wise is a good story. End game doesn't even have that! They paid Robert Downey jr. 75 million dollars for the only good scene in the entire film, and it only lasts a couple of seconds. What a waste of money.

For the love of God stop going to see Marvel movies and teach them a lesson to stop making horrible movies they aren't even superhero movies anymore. Stan Lee is gone, even when he was alive he didn't stop these terrible movies from being made, because he believed in Marvel and that it could change the world. In the beginning it did, with the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man's, Iron Man, and all of these amazing Marvel films that were actually well done and good. Stan Lee near the end, just produced these films because that's all that he knew to do. He inherently trusted these people to make great movies, and honestly they failed him and failed the original image of Marvel. Only the comics have stayed true, and even then they've come to PC for my liking, and it's so sad. Marvel won't be getting any more of my money. Hopefully you won't be giving any of yours to them anymore either. I am tired"
18 August 2019,spookybird,"Horrible movie. Boring and poorly written. I don't understand the high rating or the hype. I didn't even finish watching it because it was so awful. I love all of the Marvel movies, but this one was unwatchable. What a waste of a perfectly good Saturday night."
17 August 2019,pmama69,"Boring. Slow. Badly written, poor story.... worst of a bad bunch"
15 August 2019,chi_town_fed,"This was a terrible film. I rented it and feel like I wasted my money. The movie is 3 hours long. 2 of those hours is just nonsense and jabber. Then you get about thirty minutes of the big fight, followed by another thirty minutes of boredom.

Other than being an Avengers movie, no one would rate this garbage very high. CGI is horrible as well. I am glad I did not waste time and money at the theater for this."
31 July 2019,shohag-ldcb,Too much whining! No coherency! Completely convoluted theory about time travelling. I thought they would make something great but what the hell was that!
31 July 2019,juliaoreilly-49525,"Well if I went back in time and told my 14 year old self about this film as she watched the first Iron Man...well she would have been disappointed. This was a horrible, boring film. Waited this long for the film equivalent of a root canal, painful, boring, and way overpriced. Don't feel ashamed if you didn't like this ""film"""
30 July 2019,drgrozozo,"Absolute deconstruction of original characters and the universe, this nonsensical circus seems only aiming to cram as much ""political correctness"", painful attempts at humor and cheap pathos into torturous 3 hours. One can only wish for infinity gauntlet to snap away the bad acting, horrible scenario and hollywood itself."
20 May 2019,kcauppiax,"Just couldn't not finish it. Felt like a Kardashian Endgame. glad i didn't pay, it any money. What has happened to marvel movies in general are those positive reviews bots or bought? There were less than 1/3 action. The rest were full drama, for a almost 3 hour movie doesn't seem realistic."
14 August 2019,nobreaks,"With exception of handful actors play and CGI, this movie lacks in all aspects, thus making it outright pointless."
11 August 2019,adrian-ortiz70,"This movie was disappointing! It didn't make sense to kill off Thanos in the first 10 min of the movie.

The whole timeline opens up to many plot holes.

You can tell Captain a marvel was an afterthought. They literally had he on the movie for 15 min runtime!

This movie could have been saved if:

1. No Time Travel 2. More Captain Marvel 3. Less Grieving scenes, (We get it) 4. More Actjon!!!"
