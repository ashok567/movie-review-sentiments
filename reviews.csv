....Love that! I was just up in the mountains on a similar road with the Mini--and I realized how old the suspension has gotten after many miles. This car is really tired--it just couldn't hold the line when pushed. It was like driving a skateboard.

So your c. 10 year old Mini is worn out—and you're thinking of trading it in for a c. 20 year old Saab? You seem to be searching for exquisite automotive pain on multiple levels. Maybe a new base Mini with a manual might be something to consider? A car with new suspension parts and a warranty? Just a thought. I'm just a tad concerned that you're not able to enjoy driving as much as you should. But I realize it's none of my beeswax. Apologies...."

i think you'd enjoy four-wheel DRIVING even more than steering. Did you consider or test drive the TLX with SH-AWD? I know you probably wouldn't like the fuel economy penalty, but a test drive wouldn't hurt to give consideration for the fun factor. Although, I'd imagine the 4-banger might be overtapped with AWD.
A 4-cylinder is really enough power for me. I didn't test drive the V-6 because I knew that wasn't in the cards—and not really suited for my budget and driving style. This particular 2018 TLX Tech 2.4 4WS had more than $6k of lease incentives. I did have a trade-in, but my monthly lease payment including taxes and everything else is $229 for a car that has an msrp of $37,600. That's the right level for our budget, esp. since my wife's payment on her 3-year car loan is $450—and we have a daughter starting college in a year.

But the 4-wheel steering on the TLX is enjoyable. I worry now that I won't want a car without this feature in the future. But given that Acuras with good maintenance and some luck tend to last a long time, this is a car that may—knock on wood—be with me for a while."

So I think you answered my question, the SH-AWD is only available with the V6. The incentives were not as good on the V6's I take it?"

Yes, the super-handling awd is only available with the V-6. MSRP is significantly higher on those models, and the lease incentives weren't quite as high."
"July 27, 2018 10:48PM",benjaminh,"On those winding roads I was driving to a park that's popular with cyclists, and by chance I ended up parking my Acura TLX near a c. 2010 TL. This park is a private-public partnership and the infrastructure is excellent. Different grade levels and separate bridges for bikes and cars, rest areas for hikers and bikers, etc. One of the true treasures of the Louisville area. The bike ride up the big hill was tiring but good for this 53 year old. The bike ride down was grin-inspiring.

I've always been a high-risk buyer, not in terms of buying cars that are broken, but in terms of buying cars with a dubious reputation---often those are the most fun (for me). I think the Saab would actually be newer. The Mini is a 2003 and most of it is original, except for all the parts that literally fell off it.

Actually what the Mini really needs is sticky tires and RWD."
"July 29, 2018  6:17PM",benjaminh,"Highway mpg continues to surprise on the upside with the TLX 2.4. Some manual calculations seem to indicate that it usually inflates the mpg by about .3 mpg or so. And so 39.5 would really probably be closer to 39.2. Both of these trips were c.90% highway with speeds ranging from c. 55-75 with the ac on. Somewhat hilly ride at times. Was making a tour of the historic downtown of Corydon, Indiana, where there is a little shop that specializes in old signs."

The CR-V is a very nice vehicle—but not really my cup of tea. It really is my wife's car. But you're right that I'm going to need to start driving it to reduce the added miles on the TLX. The CR-V feels rather big and tall compared to the TLX, or really almost anything else I've ever driven except my 1969 VW Bus from so long ago. Are you thinking of a CR-V? A CR-V really has good bang for the buck, with impressive passenger and cargo room."

I already have over 2500 miles on it—and I've only owned it a month. For initial purchase price and mpg I think the 2.4 is a winner. And kept in Sport mode it's fast enough for me, but no doubt the V-6 is much faster."

I will buy another sedan at some point. Thinking a current version of the Accord EXL/Touring, TLX tech, Audi A4, used CPO. I am interested to know how the 1.5 engine performs. A friend just bought an '18 CR-V EXL AWD and says it doesn't feel as peppy as their '15 CR-V AWD which they still have. She also says the '18 feels bigger than the '15. My SIL is going to replace her '06 TL soon and says she will give it to us for my daughter to drive. It is still in excellent condition and she is the original owner. As nice as that might be, that puts a kink in my plan to give the Accord to my daughter and for me to get something 'new' for me. My wife is doing a happy dance, no new purchases! ugh"

Your daughter getting an Acura TL from a relative seems like it might be a good thing when it comes to getting a future car for you—because instead of giving your 2013 Accord EX to your daughter you can use your substantial trade-in value to get a new car for yourself. Mr.Shiftright has suggested on another thread that Audis after 80k miles tend not to be reliable, which might make an Acura or Honda better for long-term ownership. If you need a bigger back seat the Accord is going to be a better choice than the TLX, but in most other ways I think the TLX is better than an Accord. At some point you might consider test driving both."

If you need a big back seat in a sedan, you really need to look at the Passat."

I have an old friend that just testified to the following:

He took his '86 Accord to 337,000 miles, at which point it ran well, but got rear-ended and totaled.

He currently has a '04 Accord at 184K miles, His plan is to save up for the following 5 years, and then buy his race/sports car.

This came up because he lives very close to where my old S4 is for sale right now."

Well, it sounds like the author had consumed quite a bit of the Honda Kool-Aid, so I would take the article with a grain of salt. It certainly looks better than the Accord or Camry, and I suspect the handling and braking criticisms may be due to the selection of hard low rolling-resistance tires by VW. One thing I fail to undertand is how VW can take a 2L engine, turbocharge it, and end up with 174HP when other makes routinely get around 80-100HP more by doing that."

The entry-level TLX with an msrp of $33k might also be something to consider. For 3k more than an Accord EXL it offers some significant things above an Accord in terms of the steering, transmission, brakes, interior design and quality, etc. Although I've gotten somewhat used to the style of the new 2018 Accord, I still think the TLX looks better from every angle.

The A4 is also a very nice design, and the Audi is maybe the best-looking entry-level luxury car right now imho. The TLX is close, but I do think that the Acura calipers on the front grill are maybe a bit too large, like it's trying a little too hard? I'm getting used to it, but I think the styling details on the Audi are very nice.

I guess the real bargain for leasing when it comes to entry-level luxury cars is the ILX, which is basically the fanciest and most powerful 2015 Civic ever. Still, with a lease price of c. $200 a month it's a good deal for the money. It's close to the same price as leasing a Civic.

Your 2013 Accord EX might be worth c. $11-12k at trade-in, which obviously means that you have a big downpayment. Would you lean toward leasing or buying?

For entry-level luxury cars the lease deals seem better than the purchase deals."

What happens when you like driving your new car too much? In just five weeks of ownership I've put c.3300 miles on it on my newly leased TLX Tech. I love the handling, the stereo, the engine, the transmission, the seats, etc. And so I've been going on lots of fun trips to see old friends, driven to sites in town I haven't seen, and I've also been driving to cities I've never before visited. Since I'm a prof. (which perhaps explains a few things) once the school year starts in a couple of weeks I won't be driving so much since I'll be working all the time. So that should slow down the miles, and then I'll also probably start driving my wife's new CR-V sometimes when going back and forth to Lexington.

But yikes...."
"August  4, 2018 11:53PM",benjaminh,"With destination the starting price for an Acura TLX is $33,995. That's a lot of money, but for that price the TLX comes with a moonroof, power heated seats, AcuraWatch, etc., etc. An Audi A4, BMW 320i, or Lexus ES350 with about the same level of equipment all have msrps of about $41k, making the 34k for the TLX seem pretty good. But some people put the A4, 320i, and ES350 in a higher category than the TLX.

For the entry-level model TLX probably some are cross-shopping the Accord EXL 1.5, which has an msrp with destination of about $31k. So one way to look at it would be what does the TLX base have that makes it worth $3000 more than an Accord EXL.

Here's my very subjective valuation of what the added features and qualities of the TLX are worth to me personally over an Accord EXL....

The exclusive 4-wheel steering of the TLX would be worth to me as an option at least $1200. The 4WS really helps make the steering better, from parallel parking, to medium speed cornering, to higher speed lane changes. Great system imho.

The 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter is worth at least $800 to me compared to the Accord's CVT.

The better suspension of the TLX compared to the Accord is worth at least $500 to me.

The quieter ride of the TLX is also worth about $500 to me.

The TLX's better and bigger brakes with their ""Premium Bosch 6-piston brake modulator"" another 500. Plus the ten spoke wheels look better to me on the TLX than the strange designs found on the Accord.

The longer Acura warranty—4 year bumper to bumper, and 6 year/70,000 mile engine and transmission is also worth maybe 500 to me. And the fact that they threw in 2 years of maintenance in a much nicer waiting area reinforces that.

The nicer interior parts all throughout the inside the TLX, and the more interesting and better-looking to me sheetmetal outside is worth at least another 1000, and maybe twice that.

Very subjectively to me then the TLX does seem to be ""worth"" c. 5000+ more than a comparable Accord, making the added cost of 3k seem like a good deal. And with the lease incentives Acura offers it doesn't seem like you even pay that....?"

What classes do you teach? I wonder if the standard audio in the TLX is better than the current Accord EXL+ models. I do wish the standard TLX came with leather instead of faux leather.

I teach art history—and I really enjoy it!

I think the standard audio in the TLX is similar to the top-of-the-line system in the Accord EXL/Touring. So it's a very good system that's quite a bit better than what you and I hear/heard in our EXs. The ELS takes it to the next level, but the starting system is already equal to the best that Honda offers—and maybe it's even a little bit better? In terms of the leatherette, I would have been happy with that too. In fact, imho it's less worry because leatherette will last longer than probably almost anything else on the car, while leather after 8 years or so might be reaching the danger zone even if cared for.

The seating position in the TLX is just slightly lower than in my 2016 Accord.

But like you I did find the seating position of the 2018 Accord maybe a little too low.

I do enjoy the Tech features, but if they had had a TLX base on the lot I might have gotten that one if it saved me money over the Tech. It happened that it was the very last TLX 2.4 they had."

I have always enjoyed history and am sure I would enjoy your class. When I went to The Univ of TN, Knoxville, I took several French culture classes that were a mix of history and reading books written by French authors. One class was taught by a professor who had participated in the French resistance during WWII. The stories and insight that she shared, wow. I am delighted you enjoy what you do, too many don't.

To stay on topic: I see more and more TLXs on the road. For first generation it is hard to tell the 2.4 from the V6, with the rim style/tire size being the real give away. Goodyear tires on the 2.4, Bridgestone tires on the V6."

Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination.

PS Now that I've driven both the TLX and my wife's CR-V a lot, I've decided I like non-turbo engines slightly better. The 1.5T on the CR-V does have maybe a third of a second delay in acceleration when you floor it—but in certain situations that can seem like a substantial delay. And so turbo lag has been reduced with these new engines, but not completely eliminated.

PPS My guess is that the next generation TLX, due in maybe a year or so, will go turbo and take out the 4-wheel steering. I'd rather have a naturally aspirated engine and the 4WS. Right now I am hoping to finance the residual on the TLX when the lease is up, if we can afford it at that time. It's a really nice car that I'd like to keep long-term."

Floor it in a Audi with DSG on sport mode, and see if you still think turbo lag is a problem.

My guess is that the delay is more due to programming and transmission ineptitude than on the turbo lag. Does the CVT make an appearance in the CRV?"

Are you talking about Genesis Dealers or Hyundia dealers? If you go out to the Genesis web site, I think you will see a completely different type of experience. Just like Infiniti, Lexus and Acura changed the way people looked at Asian cars, Genesis dealers aren't Hyundia dealers. Granted there are no Genesis only dealerships yet, but when Rich and I went and looked at a Genesis G80, the treatment was miles a head of what you get at the Kia or Hyundia salespeople. No pressure they weren't looking to be your best friend. Just have to wait for the G70 to show up at the dealers."

Yeah, I went once to an AutoNation Lexus store. It had nice decor and everything, but the experience wasn’t the same as my local BMW dealer. It was polite, but you could still feel primary focus on sale and closing, not the product exposition and its potential fit into your life, which I felt at BMW, Audi, or even Volvo stores, every time I visited those. Something you expect at a good Toyota dealership. The difference is subtle, but perceptable. It’s mostly in the types of conversations you have with the salesman, or the manager, if he/she introduces themselves. After the visit I even received generic template follow up emails from two different managers, even though I made it clear to the sales guy the product was not interesting to me (I was looking at CT200h and it was a total dog, real disappointment). To their credit, when I responded to them saying don’t call/write and explained why, they left me alone."

I'm not sure if I'd have the patience and discipline to really keep a car for ten years—maybe eight?—but if I did this TLX would be the car for that. So far I really like the TLX on all levels—driving dynamics, comfort, awesome sound system, looks. It's by far the best car I've ever had. And given that it's an Acura I can see potentially driving it past the standard 70,000 mile engine and transmission warranty.

Not surprisingly it seems like the incentives on the 2019s are less than what was available over the summer for the 2018s. Maybe even by Thanksgiving the lease incentives might be higher again?"

Anyway, we put an extra 4k down on our the 15k loan we have for the CR-V, and so now the amount owed on it is down to 11k. If we can make another 4k extra in Dec., which might be possible, and then yet another 4k extra early next summer, that along with our monthly payments might get us free and clear on the CR-V by July or so. Then we'll just have the reasonable $229 a month lease on the TLX."
"September 26, 2018  1:47PM",benjaminhf,"The KBB reviewer makes some good points about the infotainment system on the TLX. As he says, it's not intuitive at first, but over time it becomes pretty good. And I'm now used to it and can use it pretty easily. My wife's new CR-V has just the touchscreen, and in some ways I prefer that, but believe it or not in other ways I prefer the TLX's 2-screen system. Let me try to briefly explain. So with the one touchscreen like with the CR-V—and many new vehicles these days—you are either in one display mode or another for the screen. In other words, if you've called up the stereo controls on the screen, then the map you might be using from AndroidAuto or CarPlay goes away. Same with the climate controls on the CR-V. With the system on the TLX, however, you can have two things going on at the same time. And so your navi screen at the top (which is a good place for it, right below the line of sight outward) can be doing its thing directing you to where you need to go, while the lower screen on the TLX is displaying your stereo and climate controls. Plus the touch screens, to state the obvious, are magnets for dust and fingerprints, and since you don't touch the upper screen on the TLX it stays pristine. Finally, the TLX's touch screen is more responsive than the one on the CR-V. Sometimes you need to press an electronic ""button"" on the CR-V's screen twice to activate it, while one gentle touch on the TLX's screen almost always works the first time.

In terms of handling, even my wife has said she really likes the way the TLX drives. She likes the 4-wheel steering (although it took her a couple of months to actually feel it), the handling, and the smooth power."

"October  4, 2018 12:08PM",benjaminhf,"But falling sales for ELL cars probably helps to make for the possibility of good deals....

Perhaps I'm the only one to regret it, but it looks like starting next year that lower-powered ELLs won't really be available. Currently the 320i has a 0-60 time, according to BMW, of 7.1 seconds. The Acura TLX 2.4 I have has been timed at 6.9 seconds, which is fast enough for me (and about half a second faster than my 2016 Accord CVT). But for the new generation of 3-series coming up it looks like they've not only eliminated the manual transmission but also taken out the less powerful version. So the lowest level of 2019 330i will have a 0-60 time of less than 6 seconds—but it will also cost c.$6k more than the current bottom-of-the-line 320i. Rumors are that the all-new 2020 Acura TLX will also have an standard 2-liter turbo engine with similar power and acceleration.

That's probably what almost all ELL buyers want in terms of power and acceleration, but once the least expensive 3-series starts at c.$42k msrp before options it might be out of reach for some who might otherwise buy it.

And I'm enjoying that on highway drives without ac I can get as much as 40 mpg with my 2018 TLX with the naturally aspirated 2.4 with the 8-speed transmission. I don't think a 2020 TLX with the 2.0 turbo will be able to get more than maybe 35 on the same drive, but obviously I don't know for sure. I assume that as with the 330i there will be a big price jump for the 2020 TLX. I could afford the current TLX, but the next one might be too rich for my blood....

Finally, if you really are trying to keep a car past 10 years and 100k miles, then perhaps a naturally aspirated engine might be more reliable in the long run?"

Yeah, given falling sales for almost all entry-level cars, Acura might not have much room to raise prices.

Here's my guess....the msrp for the base model 2020 TLX might only go up by c.$2k or so, but at the same time (as with the Accord) they will really cut back on lease incentives. In other words, my guess is that the ""real"" price increase might be more like $5k—almost the same price increase as for the BMW 330i—although like today a TLX will still undercut a comparable 330i by thousands of collars. My lease deal was almost too good, in that I could lease a TLX 2.4 Tech for less than an Accord EXL 2.4. I think that will almost certainly not be possible for the 2020 TLX."

And so really it's a price cut of about $3500, which shows how much Acura hopes to get some sales. The ILX is now seemingly a good deal for the money, esp compared to say an Audi A3, which comparably equipped costs almost $10k more. The base msrp of the ILX is now $25,900. Unfortunately Acura didn't put CarPlay/AndroidAuto into the base model. But for $27,650 you can get the ILX Premium which adds CarPlay/AA, leather seats, upgraded stereo, power passenger seat, BLIS, built-in garage door opener, etc.

Since the ILX weighs almost 500 pounds less than the TLX, but has almost the same engine and transmission, it is faster. I guess it's kind of a luxury Civic Si with an 8-speed dual clutch transmission....

Nothing that I see in the press release says anything about enhanced driving dynamics, so that's probably very close to the way it was before."
"October  5, 2018  1:39AM",stickguy,that is a pretty steep price cut. Wonder if they will eventually have big lease incentives on them!

My guess is that they are hoping to cut the lease incentive. But that means the monthly payments will probably be about the same as with the 2018s—c. $200 a month+ taxes and so on with c.$2500 das. In other words, only c.$30 a month and c.$500 more das than a lease on a Civic LX. But that's the best case scenario for the base model. The ILX Premium would obviously be a bit more...."
"October  5, 2018  1:58AM",stickguy,"probably going to be some good deals on the handful of leftover 2018s soon. Though at least near me, not all that many to pick from and mostly base models."
"October  5, 2018  2:03AM",benjaminhf,"Currently there seems to be a $5000+ lease incentive on the last of the 2018 ILXs. But if you wait just a few months you can probably get almost as good a deal on one of the 2019s. Sedans just aren't selling, as you know, and so it's a buyer's market. I bet your local Acura dealer would give you top dollar for your Elantra Sport if you're willing to walk away. But imho the TLX is really the better car. I'd take a base TLX with the 4-wheel steering, slightly more room, etc., etc. over a loaded ILX. If you are considering the ILX, the new style will almost certainly have better resale value."
"October  5, 2018  2:08AM",stickguy,"I would have to drive them back to back. I do find the ILX to be a better size for normal driving, though the extra room is nice when travelling, and the wife prefers a bigger car. So a TLX would be OK. no bigger than the Sonata I had was.

but I am not giving up goodies to get the bigger model. so would be comparing an ILX premium vs. a TLX tech."
"October  5, 2018  2:16AM",benjaminhf,"By the end of December I bet they will already be dealing on the 2019 ILXs. The ILX premium with the restyle and the $3.5k price cut is a good msrp. If you can get a good lease incentive of c.3k or so on top of that it should be a nice price/payment overall. The trick is the resale on your Elantra Sport. As you know, once I said I couldn't afford the TLX and it was clear I was willing to walk away, the trade-in offer on my 2016 Accord suddenly increased by quite a bit. I think you might get more from an Acura dealer for the Elantra Sport than from Carvana, esp. if you go in at the end of the sales period (end of Dec.?). They mentioned to me a few times that mine was one of the sales that put them over the top for their sales goal which helped them get a bit of a bonus from corporate."

Again, the local dealer are hopeless at best(What can I do to put ya in a car today, pal?)- and with the well know Hyundai proclivity to void warranties at the drop of a hat I could see problems with using it as my instructor car.
I just had a former Ford service advisor come to work for me in another industry. The subject of warranties came up, and he mentioned how Ford Focus RS owner's would come to him after obviously ""abusing"" their launch control button. IT was funny because his attitude wasn't like mine, which is ""why put a button or feature if the car can't handle it?"" His attitude was more like, the launch control is just for marketing, and you really shouldn't be using it if you wanted warranty covered.

I simply mentioned how Audi didn't really care, at least at the dealers I'd been too, and he admitted he's heard Ford is more ""stuck up"" than others, and heard/noticed that Honda will cover just about anything. He's a young guy so I'm sure he was just taking orders and instruction/training from more Senior Ford officials.

This confirms the stories you've heard about Ford voiding any reasonable honor of warranty."

No chance. Wagons are dead. Maybe sedans will be dead next? I wonder if in another couple of years even the ILX will be gone, replaced by an entry-level SUV about the size of the HRV."
"October  5, 2018  2:57AM",stickguy,"Acura has room for both. I am surprised they have not come out yet with a CUV below the RDX in size. Could be a serious hit. that market is hot right now, and should work well with the Acura customer base (and younger people outgrowing (financially) the Honda brand, but wanting something smaller."

With sales of the ILX last month down to 930 cars, I'd say the writing is probably on the wall. Acura saved at least a billion dollars by keeping the 2019 ILX on the 2012 Civic platform rather than making an all-new car with the 2016 Civic platform—and they've passed that savings on to the customer. But unless sales somehow explode my guess is that we're only a few years away from the end of the ILX. We'll see.

One weird little factoid is that when the ILX was first introduced for model year 2013 the list price for the base model was $25,900. And now six years later the base price of the ILX is again exactly the same—$25,900. But the 2013 ILX had the comparatively underpowered 2.0 engine as well as a lackluster 5-speed automatic transmission. The 2019 ILX has the TLX's 2.4 plus the TLX's 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter. Plus the 2019 ILX has a better interior than the 2013, a quieter ride, AcuraWatch, etc. When you account for inflation 25,900 in today's dollars would be about 29k. In other words, the 2019 ILX is a much better car with a huge price cut from 2013. But it's still difficult to get around the fact that it's a massively updated and improved 6-year old car—even if the price is now pretty compelling. Perhaps another upside is that it should be completely debugged. That seems to be the case with my 2018 TLX too."
"October  5, 2018 12:43PM",stickguy,"I saw yesterday there is supposed to be an all new (I assume accord, or RDX platform, based) 2020 TLX. Would not surprise me if they consolidated the current T and I into one sedan model, with trim levels, but added a compact CUV to replace the entry level ILX"
"October  5, 2018  1:17PM",benjaminhf,"It might help ILX sales if Acura got together a group of real people for an online ad to compare a totally loaded ILX A-spec with the Technology Package, including red leather seats, the ELS sound system, etc., which lists for $31,550 and compare it with a base BMW 320i that lists for $34,900. The ILX is almost exactly the same size as a 320i, but gets from 0-60 in c.6.6 seconds compared to 7.1 for the 320i. Get real people to beat a 320i in a drag race to 60 with an ILX. Then compare the red leather in the ILX vs. vinyl in the 320i, as well as all the things the 320i lacks without options—no moonroof, no adaptive cruise control, no CarPlay/AA, $550 extra for any color beyond white, etc. In fact if you skip the A-spec, which is mostly an appearance package, the ILX Tech now lists for $29,550—$5k less than a stripper 320i."
"October  5, 2018  1:47PM",stickguy,"Well, the new design 3 series coming out did away with the 320. So the strippo model is going to be in the mid-40s. Not even comparable.

Probably need to compare an ILX to a base FWD A3. Or a MB CLA FWD."
"October  5, 2018  1:48PM",ab348,Up until now the ILX has been a car without a market. I think it would require a sea change in buyer perceptions and attitudes to make the new one any different in that respect.
"October  5, 2018  1:50PM",stickguy,"Ab, that’s why I think it morphs into a CUV, to compete for the younger, entry level luxury buyers. And old people that want something smaller. Think X1, Volvo XC40, mini Infiniti, etc."
"October  5, 2018 10:11PM",sda,"I thought I had read that the 2018 ILX would be the last, so pleasantly surprised to see it will be around a bit longer and also like the updates. I wonder if they finally added adjustable lumbar support for the driver's seat, and a/c vents for the back seat. A friend's son recently purchased a black '16 ILX base with the 2.4 and loves it. He says it really scoots."

I think the 320 is still available for the next 6 months or so, which makes it still a fair comparison for right now. In any case, the A3 is faster than the ILX, although a lot more expensive."

Yes. I think this is almost certain to happen. There have been rumors for a couple of years about it."
"October  7, 2018 11:07AM",benjaminhf,"@stickguy imho the ILX you might consider is the step above the Premium, which is the Tech. The most important addition at that level is the ELS sound system. It lists for c. $29.5k. But wait for several months, or even the end of the model year, and there are likely to be big discounts and incentives.

Of course, you could also consider waiting for the new, smaller than RDX SUV. My guess is that it'll be introduced for model year 2020, perhaps with a starting msrp of about $31k for the 2-wheel drive version. Of course if you need BLIS and other goodies it'll probably be more like 34K. Still, it's probably going to be a good value for the money—and it will almost certainly have much better resale value than the ILX. The related flip side of that, of course, is that huge discounts on the ILX are sometimes possible, but no such thing is likely for this new SUV."
"October  7, 2018 12:30PM",sda,"I like the ILX, especially the current and newly updated '19. It isn't too small, and with the Tech model, has most of the features I'd want including the ELS. My main concern from the majority of the reviews I've read is that it has a harsh ride and is noisy, primarily road noise. Not having driven one it maybe fine as a lot of the reviews are overly critical and the reviewers bang the same drum!"

From 2013 to 2015 the ILX did have a lot of road noise, but with the 2016 refresh they added about 100 pounds of insulating material and now it's fairly quiet. Check out this KBB review of the 2017 ILX at c. 2:30 where he says the ILX now has a quiet ride...."

"October  7, 2018  8:45PM",benjaminhf,"The 2020 Cadillac CT5 (or whatever it ends up being called) looks good to me—although I also like the looks of the current ATS. Even though I like Acuras, the ILX seems below the competition in terms of prestige and often performance (except for the 320i). But since for just a little more than a Civic you can lease a base ILX it's arguably a good deal for bargain-minded customers who want a reliable and nice performing car with some luxury that's almost $10k less than the competition (when similarly optioned).

I'm in Seattle right now, and the local Audi dealer has an advertised lease on a base FWD A3 for $350 a month (plus taxes etc.) with $3250 due at signing. The A3 is a better car in some ways than an Acura ILX, but the base ILX can be leased for $200 a month (plus taxes etc.) with $2500 das. If you can pay an extra $150 a month and an extra $750 down the A3 is a better looking car imho with better performance. But if you need to save that money for something else the ILX seems like a good deal—and in the long run an Acura is likely to be more reliable than an Audi."

Interesting, I was running the 1/8th Friday Night with Race Legal (my first time ever heading over to Qualcomm to race in a straight line on a Friday night! The TTS Stage 1 was doing 7.9's, with just a measely 350 HP. The benefits of quattro AWD are very apparent in a 1/8 mile race. Especially since Qualcomm isn't a real track, and is just a parking lot conversion, and a parking lot in disrepair at that. Grip is a problem for the 2WD vehicles.

Anyway, the most interesting race was me vs. either a Hellcat or Demon, hard to tell them apart. I actually had an end time advantage by .001 seconds, but my reaction time was about .l5 slower so I lost. I was way ahead, and at the finish line they past me like I was standing still.

But having gotten dirty and sweaty changing tires in the 70s, 80s and 90s I don't want to get my clothes dirty now doing that either. I'm done with that.

My wife and I haven't had a flat in any of our various cars in our 2-car family for more than 10 years iirc. I don't know if that's just luck or if it's also that tires are better now?

I think it had an msrp with options of about 40k though. So it was nicer than an ILX, and has more brand prestige, but it was rather expensive for a small car. I could still fit in the back seat, but getting in and out was not completely easy."

""Genesis wants dealers that stick with the brand to set up dedicated showrooms, but not all dealerships are expected to make the investment. The first standalone Genesis showrooms are expected to open within a couple of years. In the next few years, Genesis will double its model line-up. Within the next three years, two SUVs, including a flagship model based on the GV80 concept and an entry-level GV70 crossover, and a sports coupe will join the G90, G80, and G70 sedans."""

""Genesis announced today that the G70 will start at $35,895, including the $995 destination fee, which prices it exactly the same as a base 320i. Both are rear-wheel drive sport sedans, both have premium features, both have turbo four-cylinder engines.

But remember the 320i is the cheapo 3 Series, the one with a less powerful version of BMW’s ubiquitous 2.0-liter turbo four. It puts out 180 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. You can get more power from a GTI these days.

For the same price, the G70 has it soundly beat: 252 HP with the eight-speed automatic or 255 HP with the six-speed manual and 260 lb-ft of torque. Go Korean over German and you’re getting a lot more power right out of the gate. You have to get the more expensive 330i at $40,000 to match the Genesis, and even the latter has slightly more power."""

Until then, they'll just be seen as ""nicer"" Hyundais. Whether that's deserved, or not.

Is the G70 an actual Stinger with just a nameplate and minor trim/body changes? I was under the impression it would be smaller?"

Yeah, Hyundai has bollocked up the Genesis brand.

Initially sold at Hyundai dealers, corporate then decided that there would be separate showrooms, but only in major markets (I think a couple hundred dealers, max).

Then - WAIT! - corporate then reversed course and said that it would be OK to continue selling the Genesis brand through existing Hyundai stores.

The store where I picked up my Elantra GT a few years back sells Genesis. But, the store itself is a bit dated; not someplace where I would want to purchase or lease my $50,000 (or up) luxury vehicle. I'd expect a more Acura / Infiniti / Lexus like environment and experience."

Agree about Genesis not really fitting well with being sold through Hyundai.

The Stinger is actually a hatchback. Although the underpinnings and engine are shared with the G70, I think the sheetmetal and interiors are different. But yes, in a sense the Stinger is the ""bargain"" G70. Looking at cars.com I saw that you can buy a brand new Stinger for c. $29k, which seems like a good deal. But then that Savage Geese reviewer complained about multiple squeaks and rattles and so it seems like they are having some quality issues.

One thing I've been enjoying about my leased TLX is that it seems so far flawless in terms of quality. Honda is good, but the Acura does seem almost like a different world."

Loaded Stingers go for $50K+ MSRP. I thought the G70 was priced a lot lower than that?"
"October 13, 2018  2:46PM",benjaminh,"Here's a base Stinger for $27k, which is almost 7k off of msrp.

"October 13, 2018  2:46PM",stickguy,they can be loaded up to that range too.
"October 13, 2018  3:01PM",benjaminh,"3.5 months into driving my first luxury car part of me wonders why I waited so long. I've driven well over 5000 miles in the TLX and so far I'm really enjoying every mile even more than I expected to. Because sales of sedans are weak some of the greatest values in leasing right now are with entry-level luxury sedans. Right now you can lease a lot of luxury cars at nice rates, including the Cadillac ATS, the Acura TLX, the Volvo S60, and for a bit more even an Alfa Romeo Giulia:
